          o You can more easily track creatures.
          When you try to track a creature, your roll for that try gains +3.
          If you succeed, you may learn about its size, how many of them there are, if it's injured or roughly how far away it is.

        Cooldown: Long Rest
        Effect: |
          Choose and mark a target.
          Your single target attacks (against Defense) against the marked target have the damage dice increased by 1 tier.
          When the target with the mark dies, you can use your Reaction to freely move the mark to another enemy.
        Notes: |
          Increasing dice by 1 tier means, for example, d6 become d8, or d10 become d12.
          D12's don't increase.

            - Movement: 5 meters
            Your pet takes its turn at the same time as you do, and always has the same initiative as yours.
            Your pet has 1 Action per turn.
            Your pet can make normal Checks using using its own Stats.
            Your pet will not stray more than 30 meters away from you in hostile territory.
            All pets have the Pet Attack ability.
            Pets can't make Opportunity Attacks.
            
        <Pet Attack>:
            A: 1 Action (from the pet)
            Effect: |

            The area around the flare lights up in a 6 meter radius, creating normal light.
            When cast, all allies in the area are cleared of Stun, Fear or Cripple.
            Allies in the area have Advantage on rolls against Fear.
            The flare lasts 1 minute.

            Effect: |
                Make an attack on a target.
                For each meter to the target, the attack deals 1d6 Pierce damage, up to 8 meters.
                For each meter to the target over 8 meters, deal one less d6.

          Choose 2 more Advanced or Basic Spells to know permanently from the Elemental, Divine and Arcane spells list.
        Notes: |
          Explanation for Charge-based:
          Instead of being able to cast each Advanced Ability you know once per Long Rest, you now have a set number of Charges.
          You can expend 1 Charge to cast 1 Advanced Ability (and there is no limit to how many times you can cast it).
          Your Charges recover on Long Rests.

        <Pet Attack>:
            A: 1 Action (from the pet)

          Effect: |
            You take on a special form, called a Watcher Form.
            Your body becomes engulfed in a magical aura (you choose its color), your eyes glow, and you can gain other aesthetics-only body transformations (customize it with your DM).
            While in this form, your first Attack deals +1d8 damage once per turn, you gain +2 Spell DC and +2 to all Combat Checks.
            Also, when you cast a spell (before you do; excluding this), you can instantly dash 3 meters, ignoring attacks of oportunity, and going through enemies and small obstacles or medium gaps.
            Lasts up to 1 minute.
          
        <Combo Set>:           # 1.5

          Effect: You gain Quickfire, Parry and Tumblestrike.
          
        <Quickfire (Hunter)> :
          A: 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Effect: |
            Perform an attack with a 1-Handed weapon.
            This attack ignores Cover and has no pentaly if you're Blinded.
            This attack does not trigger attacks of oportunity and can be used in melee range without penalty if it's a ranged weapon.            
          
        <Parry>:
          A: Reaction
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Effect: When a Unit declares a melee attack with a weapon on you (before you see the roll), you can block this attack and it deals 0 damage.
        
        <Tumblestrike>:
          A: Passive
          Effect: After you Tumble or Parry, your next Attack has the dice tiers increased.
          Notes: |
              For example, instead of 2d6, an attack would be 2d8.
              D12's don't increase, they stay d12.
              This only affects Attacks. If an Ability tells you to Attack, then it applies.
              For example, Quick Magic is not an attack.

                It can't be passed through from the direction it is facing towards.
                Lasts for 1 minute.
            Notes: |
                The wall pushes objects or willing Units away from it and can be used as a platform.
                If you decide to place it horizontally, it acts as Hard Terrain.

            Deals Main Stat extra damage if the target is below 50% Health.
            The target can't regain Health until the end of combat
          Notes: This takes 1 Action from YOU, not your pet.
          
        <Sickem>:
          A: Reaction
          Effect: |
            Use when a Unit goes flying against its will and on another Unit's turn.
            Your pet(s) within 5 meters of its landing place can dash to it (after it lands) and make a total of 3 Pet Attacks on it.
            Pets don't provoke Opportunity Attacks when dashing like this.
          Notes: |
            Goes flying means is pushed, knocked up, dragged, etc.
            This uses YOUR Reaction, not your pets'.
            Obviously, the pets need line of sight and can't jump through walls, or over large obstacles. Apply common sense.
