  Main Stat: Choose between Wisdom and Charisma. That is your Main Stat.
  Spell DC: 6 + (Main Stat)

        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          Every Worthy Enemy YOU defeat grants you 2 Holy Points.
          You also gain Proficiency in Indimidation if you don't have it already.
      
      ~Impose~ :            # 0.25

          A: Special
          Cooldown: Lifetime
          Effect: |
            Ask a party member to join your cause and pledge his/her honor to you.
            If it accepts, it gains its own pool of 6 Holy Points and can use Lay on Hands.
            That ally also benefits from Oath of Conquest.
            At any point, you can transfer any number of Holy Points from you to that ally, but not vice versa.
          Notes: |
            You can only have one character who pledged for you.

          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Notes: |
            The damage of the attack counts as the dice rolled + any modifiers.
            Using Divine Smite over an attack, for example, does not count as added to the weapon damage.
            Damage done means damage inflicted after Defense and Resistances calculations.

          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Effect: |
            You prepare to take lethal blow.
            If you would drop to 0 Health until the start of your next turn, you remain instead at 1 Health and can't take damage until the start of your next turn.
            When this happens, divine rays strike all enemies within 3 meters of you, and they all take 1d6 True damage.

            Does not apply to Passive Spells.
          Notes: |
            Increasing dice by 1 tier means, for example, d6 become d8, or d10 become d12.
            D12's don't increase.
