Spellcasting:
  Description: |
    Warlock Abilities are Charge-based, with a twist.
    As a Warlock, you have a number of Charges.
    To cast any Advanced Spell from your known spells, look at the cost of the Spell and expend that many Charges.
    You don't have restrictions for how many times you can cast a spell per Long Rest, but you have restrictions on your Charges.
  Main Stat: Choose between Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma. This is your Main Stat.
  Spell DC: 6 + (Main Stat)
  Charges:
    Amount: 2
    Regain: Your charges reset after every combat.
  Change: You can change your known Spells (not Talents) when taking a Long Rest.
  Other: All Warlock-specific abilities are considered spells.
  Known Spells: 3 + Your Intelligence + Your Level
  Spell Lists:
    - Elemental
    - Mysticism
    - Eldritch


Starting Abilities:

  ~Power Tap~ :         # 1 Charges (can use class spells)
    A: Depends
    Cooldown: Long Rest
    Effect: |
      Cast an ability one of your Allies has (with that ability's actions and costs and your modifiers).
      If it's a non-class Advanced Spell or it costs Charges, you must spend its Charges.
    Notes: Does not work on Passives. The Ability must have 0, 0.5 or 1 Actions cost.

  When creating your character, choose one type of being you serve. That being is called your Patron:

  - Celestial Patron, a being from a divine plain. Portrayed as angels or divine spirits of life and death
  - Demon or Devil patron, a being residing in Hell, an archdevil or lord in hell
  - Old God Patron, an eldritch being of nightmare and terror, whose thoughts, form and wants are incomprehensible to most people

    Description: Lorem "ipsum dolor" sit amet.
    Starting Abilities:

      ~Summon Familiar~:       # 1
        A: 1 Hour
        Effect: |
          You conjure a ritual using various magical materials worth 25 Gold.
          The first time you cast this ritual, you summon a familiar which becomes yours.
          You can choose which type of familiar you want:
          - It can take the shape of a small creature.
          - It can look spectral or look as a normal animal with a slight glow (does not radiate light).
          - You can choose what color it is if it's spectral or what color its glow is.
          Also, choose an element which is bound to it: Fire, Water, Frost, Arcane, Thunder, Earth, Wind, Light or Darkness.
          That becomes your Familiar Element.
          Your familiar comes with a name. Roll for your familiar name on the Familiar Name Table (or your DM will choose one for you).
          You can communicate with your Familiar telepathically.
          The familiar doesn't take turns on its own, but at the same time as you.
          On your turn, your familiar can use its own movement to move, but you must spend your actions for it to take actions.
          If your familiar goes more than 20 meters away from you, it becomes unsummoned.
          If it dies, it becomes unsummoned.
          You can always summon it back with this Ability.
          After your familiar is unsummoned, you can only summon it back after your next Long Rest.
          Your familiar has the following stats:
          - Health: 8 + Your Fortitude + 2 * Your Level.
          - Defense: Your Dexterity (minimum 0)
          - Stats and Saves: Same as yours
          - Movement: Same as yours, can't fly, but it can swim at half normal speed

        Cooldown: 1 turn
        Effect: |

          The attack deals 1d10 + Main Stat damage (of your pet's elemental type).
        Notes: The attack is against target's Defense, of course.
        
      ~Familiar Feats~:
        A: Special
        Effect: |

      Level 4:
      
        <Demon Shape>:
        
        <Patron Avatar>:            # 2 turns  = 2 Charges
          A: 0 Actions
          Cost: 1 Charge
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Range: 6 meters
          Effect: |
            You summon an Avatar of your patron.
            While the Avatar is summoned, you can't move, except with teleportation Spells.
            You and the Avatar share Actions and you must use at least 0.5 Actions with it every turn, otherwise it becomes unsummoned.
            The Avatar can't take damage or be directly Crowd Controlled, but all Crowd Control you would take is redirected to it.
            See the Avatar's Stats and Abilities in the Pets sections.
            Lasts up to 1 minute or until you are Stunned, Paralyzed or physically moved from place, or if the Avatar moves outside of a 30 meter range.
          Notes: You can cancel the summon at any point on your turn.
