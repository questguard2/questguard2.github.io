    To cast any Advanced Spell from your known spells, you must expend 1 Charge.
    You don't have restrictions for how many times you can cast a spell per Long Rest, but you have restrictions on your Charges.
    Advanced Abilities are all Abilities from the Spell Lists listed as Advanced.
    If an Ability is not listed as Advanced, you can use it as many times as you like.

  Main Stat: Choose between Wisdom or Charisma. This is your Main Stat.
  Spell DC: 6 + (Main Stat)
  Charges:
    Amount: 3
    Regain: You regain all Charges back when you Long Rest.
  Change: You can change your known Spells (not Talents) when taking a Long Rest.
  Other: All Warrior-specific abilities are considered Maneuvers (unless stated otherwise).
  Known Spells: 1 + Your Intelligence + Your Level
  Spell Lists:
    - Maneuvers

    - Fighter, a person specialized in weapon fighting and body-to-body combat

        <Might Over Magic>:     # 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            Choose an Advanced spell from the Elemental spell list that deals damage.
            You can cast that spell once per Long Rest.
            That spell becomes a physical version of itself.
            Instead of using magic to cast that spell, you use your body/weapons/tools.
            Come up with a description of how it works (see notes).
            The damage of that spell becomes Slash, Smash or Pierce, whichever makes sense.
            It counts as a Maneuver.

            E.g. Scorching Rays - you shoot 3 arrows with your bow (Pierce damage).
            E.g. Frost Nova - you smash the ground with such force that it damages and slows units around you (Smash damage).
