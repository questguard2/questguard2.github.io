Spellcasting:
  Description: |
    Rogue Abilities are Charge-based.
    As a Rogue, you have a number of Charges.
    To cast any Advanced Spell from your known spells, you must expend 1 Charge.
    You don't have restrictions for how many times you can cast a spell per Long Rest, but you have restrictions on your Charges.
    Advanced Abilities are all Abilities from the Spell Lists listed as Advanced.
    If an Ability is not listed as Advanced, you can use it as many times as you like.

  Main Stat: Choose between Intelligence or Charisma. This is your Main Stat.
  Spell DC: 6 + (Main Stat)
  Charges:
    Amount: 2
    Regain: You regain all Charges back when you Long Rest.
  Change: You can change your known Spells (not Talents) when taking a Long Rest.
  Other: All Rogue-specific abilities are considered Maneuvers (unless stated otherwise).
  Known Spells: 1 + Your Intelligence + Your Level
  Spell Lists:
    - Maneuvers


Spellcasting:
  Main Stat: Choose between Intelligence and Charisma. This is your Main Stat.
  Spell DC: 10 + (Main Stat)
  Charges:
    Amount: 3
    Regain: You regain all Charges back when you Long Rest.
  Change: You can change your known Maneuvers (not Talents) every Long Rest.
  Number of known maneuvers: 1 + Your Intelligence + Your Level

# Idea: For each Charge spent on Ambush, X happens

Starting Abilities:
  
  ~Ambush~ :      # 0.75
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      While Hidden, your first attack deals 1d6 + 1 extra damage.
      When Ambushing, you can also spend as many Charges as you want.
      That attack gains 1d6 + 1 damage more for each Charge spent.
      Ambush can only happen once per turn.
    Notes: |
      Your Specialization will give you extra ways to Ambush.
      You can't stack 2 Ambushes at the same time, obviously.
      
  ~Hide~ :
    A: Special
    Requirement: 2 Dexterity (or more)
    Cooldown: Once per encounter
    Effect: |
      When combat starts, if you have Cover, you start as Hidden.
      While Hidden, you can skip your turn.
      Then, you can unhide and start your turn whenever you like (even during enemies' turns).
      If you did this, when your turn ends, you are no longer hidden.
    Notes: |
      Essentially, you can interrupt another Unit's turn, put that unit on pause, and start your turn. When your turn ends, the Unit resumes its turn.
      If you want to start during an enemy's turn, you do so when they declare they want to do something or after they finish doing something.
      In special circumstances, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity Check to remain Hidden.
      You can't become Hidden through non-Ability means.

            At the end of your next turn, the blades return to you.
            Then, again, each blade deals 2d6 direct Slash damage (not against Defense) to all Units it passes through.
