Spellcasting:
  Description: |
    Mage Abilities are Charge-based.
    As a Mage, you have a number of Charges.
    To cast any Advanced Ability from your known spells, you must expend 1 Charge.
    You don't have restrictions for how many times you can cast a spell per Long Rest, but you have restrictions on your Charges.
    Advanced Abilities are all Abilities from the Spell Lists listed as Advanced.
    If an Ability is not listed as Advanced, you can use it as many times as you like.
  Main Stat: Intelligence
  Spell DC: 6 + (Main Stat)
  Charges:
    Amount: 3
    Regain: You regain all Charges back when you Long Rest.
  Change: You can change your known Spells (not Talents) when taking a Long Rest.
  Other: All Mage-specific abilities are considered spells (except Magic Mastery).
  Known Spells: 3 + Your Intelligence + Your Level
  Spell Lists:
    - Elemental
    - Arcane
    - Conjuration
    - Mysticism
      
    
Starting Abilities:

  ~Magic Mastery~:
    A: 0 Actions
    Cost: 1 Charge
    Effect: |
      The next ability you use that has the cost of 1 Action now costs 0.5 Actions.
      This is considered a Maneuver.

  Choices:
    - Sorcerer, a born user of magic, floating with the hard to control magic itself
    - Wizard, who became a master of magic through intense study, and carries its spells in an indispensible tome

    Starting Abilities:
    
      ~Charisma Caster~:
        A: Passive
        Effect: You can freely use Charisma as your Main Stat, if you choose to do so.
    
      ~Innate Magic~ :
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          When you cast a spell, if it's different than the previous spell you casted, the previous spell becomes Exhausted, even if it's a Basic Spell.
          This means you can't use that previous spell until your next Long Rest.
        Notes: |
            Example: 3 turns in a row, you cast Fire Bolt; next turn, you cast Magic Missiles; after this, you can't cast Fire Bolt again until the next Long Rest.

      ~Overcharge~ :      # 2 Charges
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          After you cast a spell the 3rd time in a row, your next ability benefits from Magic Mastery.
          After this, that spell becomes Exhausted and can't be used until the next Long Rest.
      
    Talents:
      Level 2:
        <Eldritch Specialization>:  # 1 Charge
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You gain access to the Eldritch Spell List, and when you cast an Eldritch Spell, you can choose to split the d8's into 2d4's and d12's into 2d6's.
          Notes: |
            For example, if a Spell deals 2d8 damage, that becomes 4d4.
            it might sound like the same thing, but because of math, 4d4 is actually, on average, 1 extra damage compared to 2d8.
  
        <Wild Cast>:                # 1
          A: 1 Action
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Effect: |
            Roll 1d6 and 1d8. This spell has the effect of the 2 combined rolls.
            For the 1d6:
            1. Attack a target for 3d6 Fire Damage
            2. A target must pass a Dexterity Check or take 2d8 Cold Damage (or half if it passes).
            3. Target all Units in a 4x4 area. Attack them all for 2d6 + 2 Shock Damage.
            4. Two Units instantly take 6 Force Damage.
            5. Attack all units in a 6x1 line from your position for 4d4 Pierce Damage.
            6. One Unit you choose takes 1d10 Force Damage and is pushed 3 meters away from you.
            For the 1d8:
            1. Nothing else happens.
            2. Target(s) all take an extra 2d6 Damage (directly) of the damage type of the 1d6 effect..
            3. Target(s) must pass an Dexterity Check or be Snared.
            4. Target(s) must pass an Dexterity Check or be Crippled.
            5. Target(s) must pass an Intelligence Check or be Silenced.
            6. Target(s) must pass a Wisdom Check or be Feared.
            7. Target(s) must pass a Wisdom Check or be Dazed.

            Whenever you cast an Advanced Spell or use Magic Mastery, roll 1d12.
            If you roll 12, something wild happens!
      
      Level 4:
      
        <Arcane Comet>:     # 2 Charges damage at 8 meters
            A: 1 Action
            Cooldown: Long Rest
            Range: 8 meters
            Effect: |
                Shoot a comet that changes in power the longer it travels - it deals damage and Crowd Controls a target.
                It deals 1d4 Force damage (against Defense) for every meter it travels (up to 8d4).
                However, the longer it travels, the weaker it's Crowd Control is.
                Apply the following Crowd Control (directly) to the target depending on the distance traveled (distance between you and the target):
                - 1 or 2 meters: Stun
                - 3 or 4 meters: Daze
                - 5 or 6 meters: Snare
                - 7 or 8 meters: None

        <Star Burst>:       # +5.5 extra damage per Charge spent (but its so random it still might be too weak)
            A: 0.5 Actions
            Cost: 1 Charge
            Effect: |
                Declare up to 4 different targets within 15 meters.
                Assign a different number from #1 to #4 to each.
                Roll (3 + Main Stat) d4's. Each number deals that much Shock damage to the target with that number.
                Each rolled 1 deals 1 damage to target number #1.
                Each rolled 2 deals 2 damage to target number #2.
                And so on.
            Notes: |
                E.g. if you put #2 on a goblin, and you roll three 2's on the d4's, then that goblin takes 6 Force damage.
                You should probably assign the higher number to the target you want to do most damage to.
                You can declare fewer targets, but then the missing number will deal damage to no target.
                
        <Mystically Unleashed Thaumaturgic Arcane Torrent Essence>:
            A: Passive
            Effect: Your single-target Spells that deal half damage when a target passes a Check now deal the full damage regardless.
            Notes: That means spells like Acid Burst don't even require a Check anymore.

          Some of your class spells require you to use your Artificer's Tools (described below).
          If they require you to spend Charges, those Charges become locked and can't be regained through any means, until the item created is used or destroyed.
          For 1 Action, you can summon or vanish your Artificer's Tools.

          Feel free to be creative with what you can do - the tools might do other small artificer tasks as well. Ask your DM!
        Notes: |
          Spells noted as 'Artificer' require you to use Artificer's Tools.
          If you ever lose your Artificer's Tools, the price for a new set is 200 gold.
          As usual, items created this way require 0.5 Actions to use.
          Artificer potions do not count towards the potion limit cooldown.
          Artificer's Tools's small tasks are a non-combat. You can't use them to deal damage, crowd control or heal.

      Level 4:
        
        <Artificer - Golem>:            # 2, but it costs 1 Charge so it sounds fair.
            A: 1 Action
            Cost: 1 Charge
            Range: 3 meters to edge
            Effect: |

              Choose if it's made of Clay, Metal or Flesh.
              It has different abilities based on its material.
              You can find the Golem's stats in the Pets section.
            Notes: The Golem has 0 initiative, so it usually takes its turn last in combat.
              
        <Artificer - Autoturret>:       # 1.5 but you can summon a ton of them
            A: 0 Actions
            Cost: 1 Charge
            Range: 6 meters
            Cooldown: 2 times / Turn
            Effect: |
                Choose an element: Fire, Cold, Shock or Force.
                Choose an empty space to deploy an Autoturret of that element.
                On your turn, you can freely make one attack with each Autoturret for 1d4 direct damage that ignores Defense and all resistances.
                It has 5 Health, 7 Defense and fails all Checks.

        <Artificer - Grenade>:          # 2, but it costs 1 Charge so it sounds fair.
            A: 0.5 Actions
            Cost: 1 Charge
            Range: 6 meters to edge
            Cooldown: 1 use / Encounter
            Effect: |
                Throw a grenade at a target 5x5x5 meter area.
                Choose one of the following effects. They apply to all Units caught in the area.
                - Units must pass a Might Check or be Stunned
                - Units must pass a Dexterity Check or take 6d4 Smash, Pierce or Slash damage (you choose) and be knocked away from the center of the area to closest space outside of the edge of the area. If a unit passes, it only takes half of that damage.
                - The grenade explodes at the start of your next turn and deals 4d8 + Main Stat Fire damage (against Defense).
            Notes: Alternatively, you create the Grenade out of combat and give it to an ally to use. If you do this, only one Grenade can be thrown during a combat. A second grenade has no effect (since it's magical by nature and draws from your magic power).

      Level 6:
                
        <Artificer - Magic Armor>:
            A: 5 minutes
            Cooldown: Long Rest
            Effect: |
                You magically enchant a piece of armor until your next Long Rest.
                Choose 2 of the following effects to apply to it:
                - +1 Defense
                - Choose a damage type. Wearer takes only 50% damage from that type.
                - +2 meters Movement Speed, and the wearer can freely jump up to 2 meters (up or ahead; this still uses Movement).
