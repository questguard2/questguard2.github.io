  Description: |
    Druid Abilities are Exhaust-based.
    As a Druid, you know a certain number of Advanced Abilities.
    You can cast each Advanced Ability you know ONCE, then it becomes unusable (Exhausted) until your next Long Rest.
    Advanced Abilities are all Abilities from the Spell Lists listed as Advanced.
    If an Ability is not listed as Advanced, you can use it as many times as you like.
    
  Main Stat: Wisdom
  Spell Grade: 6 + (Main Stat)
  Change: You can change your known Spells (not Talents) when taking a Long Rest.
  Other: All Druid-specific abilities are considered spells (unless stated otherwise).
  
  Known Basic Spells: 2 + Your Intelligence
  Known Advanced Spells: 1 + Your Level
  
  Spell Lists:
    - Elemental
    - Nature
    - Mysticism

Starting Abilities:
  ~DruiGraderaft~ :            # Ok

      You can create harmless sensory effects or tiny weather effects (6 meters range).
      You can massively speed up the growth of small plants (touch range).
      You can slightly soothe physical pains (with no combat effect) (touch range).
      You can attempt to communicate simple ideas with animals and plants (3 meters range).
      You have +3 on rolls for identifying plants.
      You can do these even while Shapeshifted.

  ~Animal Attack~:
    A: 1 Action
    Effect: |
      Make a melee attack for 2d8 + your Main Stat (not the animal's).

  ~Shapeshift~ :            # Ok, 0.75
    A: 1 Action
    Cooldown: 2 times / Long Rest (see effect)
    Effect: |
      Pick an animal from the Animal Pets and Shapeshift Animals list and instantly transform into it.
      As soon as you Shapeshift, you can perform an Animal Attack.
      You gain that animal's Fortitude and Dexterity saves.
      Apply any other modifiers (except for base Stats) from that animal.
      You also gain its exact abilities.
      While Shapeshifted, you can do Animal Attack.
      While Shapeshifted, you can do any maneuvers you know. You can't cast spells.
      When you Shapeshift, your Health stays the same, unless the animal states it has a bonus/minus to Health.
      When Shapeshift ends, subtract back whatever health you added, or add back whatever health you subtracted.
      When you end Shapeshift, if your health would be 0 or less, it stays at 1.
      Shapeshift ends if you drop to 0 Health, and you go Unconscious.
      At first, you can't fly, even if your animal can. If your animal can fly, you have Proficiency in Jumping and you can glide (you don't take falling damage).
      From Level 3, you can use this 3 times per Long Rest.
      From Level 6, you can use this 4 times per Long Rest and you can fly.
      From Level 9, you can use this 5 times per Long Rest.
    Notes: |
      You can't make attacks with ranged weapons while Shapeshifted (obviously).
      You choose what items you keep on you when Shapeshifting, and those items are 'merged' into your new form.
      You can turn back into your humanoid form for 0 Actions (on your turn).

  Coven of the Old Ways:        # 1.75
    Description: |
      You worship the sun, the moon and the stars, for only they can truly guide your path.
      Pagan Druids believe no one has the right to dictate someone else's spiritual path.
      As a Pagan Druid, you oppose fanaticism, opressors and stupidity.
      Pagan Druids usually worship no god, but they do acknowledge their power and they heavily respect nature and the earth.
      A Pagan Druid gains the power through not black, nor white magic.
      The suggested alignment for Pagan Druids is True Neutral.


      
    Starting Abilities:
      ~Day Night Cycle~ :       # 0.5
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          Instead of knowing one set of spells, as normal, you know two: one for the moon, and one for the sun.
          The Moon spells can only be used at night (from end of dusk until start of dawn).
          The Sun spells can only be used at day (from start of dawn until end of dusk).
          The Sun spell set and the Moon spell set can not contain any of the same spell.
        Notes:
          So, in total, you know twice as many Basic and Advanced spells.
        Downside:
          Once you prepare a spell for Day or Night, you can no longer assign it to the other one. Ever.
      
      ~Moonsun Fire~ :          # 1.25
        A: 0.5 Actions
        Range: 6 meters
        Cooldown: Day/Night (see below)
        Effect: |
          A target within 6 meters makes a Wisdom Check.
          If it fails, it takes 1d4 + Main Stat Fire Damage and is Crippled (if day) or True damage and is Silenced (if night).
          It takes half of that damage if it passes.
          If you use this at night, you can't use it until day, and vice versa.

            - Movement: 5 meters

            Your pet has 1 Action per turn.
            Your pet can make normal Checks using using its own Stats.
            Your pet will not stray more than 30 meters away from you in hostile territory.
            All pets have the Pet Attack ability.
            Pets can't make Opportunity Attacks.

            A: 1 Action (from the pet)
            Effect: |
                The pet melee attacks a target.

        <Equinox>:              # It's 0.5 Actions + 1 Charge = 2 Charges
          A: 0.5 Actions
          Cooldown: Day/Night
          Effect: |
            If it's day, choose up to Main Stat Units within 15 meters.
            They must pass a Wisdom Check or they forget to how to use ranged attacks or spells for 1 turn.

  Coven of the Wild:            # +0.5
    Description: You are heavily in touch with nature and with strange creatures, uncommon to the normal folk.
    Starting Abilities:
    
      ~Wild Shape~ :            # 0.5
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          When you use Shapeshift, you can transform into a combination of 2 animals.
          You take the highest stat from both animals, and you have access to both of their abilities.
        Notes: |
          For example, you could transform into a combination of Bird of Prey and Bear, resulting in a kind of Owlbear, with a lot of health and a lot of Armor! Be creative!
          The animal size is either the larger or the smaller of the two - your choice.
          Even if you Shapeshift into 2 combinations of a same animal, the cooldown of that animal's Ability persists (e.g. you can't use Bear's Maul twice per Long Rest, no matter what animal combination you transform into).

      Level 2:
        <Forest Friend>:          # 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You have a Pixie companion, a very small humanoid with wings.
            The Pixie has 10 Defense, 1 HP, 5 Movement Speed.
            It takes its turn at the same time as you and it has 0.5 Actions on its turn.
            It can't attack with weapons, but it can use scrolls and potions.
            Every Long Rest, you can teach it one Basic Spell that costs 0.5 Actions from any Spell List and it can cast it once for 0.5 Actions until the next Long Rest.
            If the Pixie goes more than 50 meters away from you, it becomes unsummoned (you can summon it back by channeling for 10 minuets).
            The Pixie has Charisma, Wisdom and Intelligence equal to yours, but its Dexterity is 0 and its Might is -5.
            Decide with your DM whether you or the DM controls the Pixie roleplay-wise.
            Have fun!

            You can also use Shapeshift to also transform into other people.
            When you want to do this, roll a Deception check.
            This check determines how close you get to the form of that person (12 or more means a perfect copy).
            This copy just mimicks the look of the person, not the voice or personality.

  Coven of the Wicked:          # 1.5
    Description: |
      Witch druids use eldritch magic of the nature to bend reality in an unseen way, cast curses and dispell magic.

      Wiccan Druids worship no god, but they do acknowledge their power and they heavily respect nature and the earth.

        <Animal Companion> :        # 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You have an animal pet that can fight alongside you!
            Your animal has stats depending on its species.
            By default, apply the following stats to your pet (these will get modified by your pet's species):
            - Movement: 5 meters
            Your pet takes its turn at the same time as you do, and always has the same initiative as yours.
            Your pet has 1 Action per turn.
            Your pet can make normal Checks using using its own Stats.
            Your pet will not stray more than 30 meters away from you in hostile territory.
            All pets have the Pet Attack ability.
            Pets can't make Opportunity Attacks.
            
        <Pet Attack>:
            A: 1 Action (from the pet)
            Effect: |
                The pet melee attacks a target.
                The attack deals 1d6 + 2 Pierce of Slash Damage (your choice).

      Level 4:
      
        <Regrowth>:
          A: 1 Action
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Effect: Heal a Unit within 6 meters for 1d8 for each 10 Health it is missing.
        
        <Dazzling Miasma>:
          A: 1 Action
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Effect: |
            Shoot a tainted gust of spores in a 10x1 meter line from your position.
            It hits the first 2 Units it travels into.
            If you hit one Unit, it must pass a Might Check or take 4d10 Poison damage (or half of that if it passes).
            If you hit 2 Units, they must pass a Might Check or be Stunned and take 1d10 Poison damage (or half of that if they pass).
        
        <Animate Plants>:       # Easily 2 Charges; first turn is easily 1 Charge
          A: 1 Action
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Effect: |
            Choose 3 plants you can see. They become animated and fight for you.
            The Abilities and stats of the plant depends on what type of plant it is (see the Pets page).
            You don't control your plants; they attack the closest enemy to them, or use their Ability when they can.
            When a Plant reaches 0 Health, it doesn't die, but it becomes de-animated.
            Pick the plant type from the Druid Plants list that fits the plant the best.
            Lasts up to 10 minutes.
