          You can do this once per Long Rest, and lasts until your next Long Rest.
        Notes: This does apply to Proficiencies - if your bonded ally has Proficiency in something, you also add the ally's Level, as it would normally make sense.

        A: 1 Action
        Cooldown: Long Rest
        Range: 15 meters

            Place a tether on 2 Units within 10 meters of you.
            The next time one of them takes damage, the other one takes the damage (directly) as well as True damage.
          Notes: |
            If both are damaged at the same time, this only applies once and you choose which takes the damage of the other.
            The extra damage of Smites, Ambush, etc count over an attack counts as the same damage source.
            If another case is ambiguous, the DM makes the choice if it counts.

    Starting Abilities:
    
      ~Spirit Guides~	:     # 0.5
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          You are in constant communion with certain spirits.
          These spirits can be the souls of people you knew who died, spirits of other animals, etc.
          These spirits will sometimes guide your way and aid you in your endeavors.
          After every Long Rest, roll 1d6 and remember what you rolled.
          These dice are called Guide Dice.
          You can freely consume one Guide Dice and add it to any Check you or your party makes.
          At levels 2, 5 and 8, you gain one more Guide Die.

      ~Hex and Curse~:        # 1?
        A: 0.5 Actions
        Cooldown: 2 uses / Long Rest
        Effect: |
          Declare either an ally or an enemy within 6 meters.
          If it's an enemy, it must pass a Wisdom Check or have all its damage dice downgraded 1 tier for 1 minute.
          If it's an ally, it must pass a Wisdom Check to be healed for 1d12, or half of that if it fails.
          Downgrading can stack (you can downgrade an enemy's dice multiple times).
        Notes: |
          Downgrading dice by 1 tier means, for example, d6 become d4, or d12 become d10.
          D4's don't decrease.
          If you target an Epic Monster, the tier downgrade happens to its first turn only.

        <Voodoo Magic> :        # 1
          A: 1 Action
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Range: 6 meters
          Effect: |
            A Unit within 6 meters makes a Wisdom Check.
            If it fails, it takes 2d6 Psychic damage at the start of your turn for 1 minute and for its next turn, you can choose that enemy's actions as long as it would seem reasonable to that enemy (decide with your DM).
            Epic Monsters can not be controlled; they only take the damage.
          Notes: For example, you can make a goblin run or recklessly attack one of your party members. But you can't make a guard jump off a cliff, because that's not what it would normally do.

        <Incorporeal Form> :
          A: 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Effect: |
            You become a bodyless soul for up to 8 hours and enter a willing ally.
            While inside the ally's body, you can communicate with them mentally, and only they can see you.
            You can slightly peek outside of their body, and move your arms, upper body and head as if you were a ghost originating from that ally's body.
            o You can't move yourself, but you always move with that ally.
            o You can't do any physical actions (because you are basically a ghost and can't touch anything or anyone).
            o You can cast spells as normal. 
            o You follow your own Initiative in combat.
            o You can't take damage from external sources, but you feel every body sensation that ally feels.
            You can freely exit their body and revert back to your physical self using 0 Actions.

            - Add to another ally's damage roll
            - Subtract from an enemy's damage roll
            - Add to another ally's Combat Check
            - Subtract from an enemy's Combat Check
            You can only use 1 Guide Die at a time.
        
        <Dead Hands>:          # 2
          A: 1 Action
          Cost: 1 Guide Die
          Effect: |
            Choose a 3x3 meter zone.
            Undead hands appear in that zone and make it Hard Terrain.
            At the start of your next turn, use one of your Guide Dice to summon that many Zombies wherever you choose in that zone.
            They take their turn the same time as you and you can command them to do whatever you want.
            They have 4 Speed, 1 Health, 3 Defense and fail all saves.
            Each can attack for 1d4 - 1 direct Necrotic damage (ignores Defense).
            Zombies last up to 10 minutes.

        <Bone Mass>:           # 2
          A: 0.5 Actions
          Cost: 1 Guide Die
          Range: 6 meters to edge
          Effect: |
            Spend one Guide Die and declare a square area.
            The diameter of the area is equal to the spent Guide Die.
            Sharp bones occupying 1x1 meters each grow from the area.
            When a Unit steps on a Sharp Bone, it directly takes 1d8 Pierce Damage and loses 1 meter of its remaining speed.
            The bone then shatters.
