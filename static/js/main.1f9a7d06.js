Like Proficiency in Acrobatics (bonus to all Checks that can be interpreted as \\"acrobatics\\") or Proficiency in Occultism (bonus to all Checks about knowing \\"occult\\" or dark information).\\nA Proficiency always gives you a bonus equal to your Character\'s Level. So, if you want to jump from a balcony to another and you have Proficiency in Acrobatics, you make a Dexterity Check and add your Level to that Check. The final number is your result for the Check.\\n\\nEvery Class gives you certain Proficiencies and lets you also pick a number of them, depending on your Intelligence.\\nYou can find a list of Proficiencies under Database, Proficiencies, All.

The game is easier to learn, play, host games for as a Game Master and provides more combat options and strategies packed in a simpler set of rules.\\nWe created this game out of love for tabletop roleplaying games and disappointment with many aspects of existing systems. Our CoH community feels many aspects of the traditional tabletop games are lackluster and not designed for the modern world. It is a game in the same genre as D&D and Pathfinder: it\'s made for a fantasy setting, has turn based combat, etc. If you played either of these systems, you will find CoH very easy to pick up!\\n","Is this a D&D offspin?":"No. It\'s a different game. However, Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder are the main inspiration sources for Call of Heroes.\\nWhile exploring the rules of Call of Heroes, you will find a lot of simplification for the better. Many features are removed and tweaked, and other features have been added, all for the sake of modernization and ease of play without taking away from the fun parts. We have removed what\'s not fun and made what\'s already fun even more exciting! However, Call of Heroes is not merely a modification of D&D. It is not a form of 5.5th Edition or an offspin. It\'s an entirely different game and should be treated as such. Content is not backwards compatible with neither D&D or Pathfinder - but it is better!\\n","Why Call of Heroes and not D&D?":"Blalaflala\\n"},"CoH For D&D Players":{"D12 System":"Call of Heroes is a d12 system instead of d20. When you make a check, you roll a 12-sided die and add any modifiers to it.\\n12 sides instead of 20 sides makes Checks less swingy and makes adding numbers easier.\\nCritical successes and failures can happen when rolling a d12 - if you roll 12 on the die, that counts as a Critical Success and it counts as if you rolled 15.\\nRolling a natural 1 is not considered a Critical failure. Instead, a Critical Failure happens when your total result is 0 or less (from a negative modifier, like having -1 in a certain Stat).\\n\\nWhen in combat, there is no rolling to hit - you roll Damage directly and subtract Defense.\\nHowever, Critical Strikes do exist in combat as well, but they are specific to various weapons and Spells. If a weapon or Spell can Critically Strike, it is mentioned in the weapon/Spell text (with what needs to happen for it to be a Critical Strike).\\n","Characters":"This section explains the basics of the player characters. Later sections describe how combat works and how Game Mastering is different from other systems.\\nLike in D&D, a character is defined by a Race and a Class (there is no background). Each Class has a different set of specializations and each Race a set of extra Feats.\\nEach Specialization provides tons of options for character customization!\\n","Player Character Progression":"In Call of Heroes, characters go from Level 1 up to Level 10. In terms of how much time and experience it takes to get from 1 to 10, it\'s not the equivalent of getting from 1 to 20 in D&D.\\nIn fact, getting from Level 1 to Level 10 in Call of Heroes is slightly faster than going from Level 1 to Level 10 in Dungeons and Dragons.\\n\\nHowever, the levels _are_ more packed and flavorful than in D&D!\\nEvery 2 Levels, you get to pick a class Talent from 3 to 4 choices. These are Talents are usually powerful Abilities that define your playstyle! This means that, judging only by the number of Talents, each Specialization has over 500 possible Talent combinations, and that\'s not even counting your Feats and other Class choices (e.g. Warlocks and Clerics get another set of extra Talents at Level 1). Pick your poison!\\nLeveling up happens either through Experience Points awarded by the GM (from killing monsters, completing puzzles, etc) or through a milestone system (e.g. leveling up after completing a certain part of the story).\\n","Character Stats":"Ability Scores (from D&D) are called simply Stats in Call of Heroes.\\nThere are 5 Stats in Call of Heroes: Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Sense and Charisma.\\nStrength and Constitution are combined into one single stat: Might. Might affects Damage with some weapons and your base Health. The overall Health is determined more by your Class and Talents rather than by your Might. So don\'t worry! You\'re not losing on that much Health if you choose to start with -1 Might.\\nWhen you create your character, you assign the following numbers in any order to your Stats: 3, 2, 1, 0, -1. Every Character will have one strong Stat and one weak Stat.\\nThere are no tables for converting a Stat to a Modifier like in D&D. The Stats themselves are the modifiers. It\'s that simple!\\nYou gain extra Stat Points at Levels 4 and 8 and you can also get extra Stat Points through Feats and Talents.    \\nYou might be thinking about how Races affect your Stats. Instead of giving you extra points in some Stats, Races impose some extra rules for distributing Stats. For example, Orcs allow you to put assign your Stats however you like with those numbers as long as your Might is at least 2.\\n\\nUnlike in D&D, there are no sub-stat Skills (Athletics, Perception, etc). Instead, all Checks are done directly with the Stat and the player can choose in some cases which Stat they want to use.\\nInstead, to specialize in different skills, there exist Proficiencies!\\nBecause there are too many sub-stats to cover all possibilities, each Race and Class gives characters Proficiency in certain skills of choice.\\nProficiencies are worded in such a way that they are applicable to more situations than in D&D! For example, if you have Proficiency in Intimidation, you will get a bonus to all rolls for Intimidation, whether you want to use your Charisma or your Might.\\nThis makes the life of both the Game Master and the Players easier. No longer do they have to memorize all 20 sub-skills. If it\'s jumping, it\'s either Might or Dexterity! And if a player knows they\'re good at jumping, they\'ll just call it out and add the Proficiency bonus.\\nThe Proficiency bonus is equal to your Level. So, even if your Intelligence is low, you might still know a lot about Occultism. After all, it makes sense you do if you grew up in a coven of witches...\\n","Combat, Turns and Actions":"Just like in D&D, combat happens on a map (preferably on a grid).\\nEach player rolls Initiative (1d12 + Initiative) to determine their turn order. Monster usually have a fixed Initiative, so similar monster groups take their turns at the same time, thus increasing the speed of preparation for combat.\\n\\nIn a turn, a Unit can move up to its speed and use 1 Action, which can be divided into 2 Half-Actions.\\nThere is no Bonus Action, but there are plenty of Abilities that cost 0 Actions (are completely free and can do as many as you like per turn).\\nLike in D&D, each Unit also has a Reaction they can use during other Units\' turns for some situational moves.\\n\\nHalf-Actions are useful because provide more options during combat. As a general rule of thumb, an action taking 2 hands usually costs 1 Action. If it can be done with one hand, it usually takes a half action.\\nDon\'t worry though! Each Ability is well worded and specifies how many Actions it takes to make.\\n\\nSaving Throws are simply called Resist Checks and are rolled with the Stat Modifier. Some Talents and Abilities grant you bonus modifiers to certain Resist Checks.\\n","Moving":"Inherit from Rules.yml","Attacking and Defense":"To recap, on your turn, you have 1 Action, which can be divided into 2 Half-Actions.\\nAttacks with one-handed weapons take a Half-Action and attacks with two-handed weapons take 1 Action.\\n\\nWhen you Attack with a weapon, you roll directly for Damage - there is no rolling to hit. You then subtract the target\'s Defense from the Damage, and that\'s the final result Damage the target takes.\\nAssuming you are Trained in the weapon you are attacking with (see Training), the attack deals (weapon base Damage) + (your Might or Dexterity, as mentioned by the weapon). Each Weapon is used with either Might or Dexterity. When you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon\'s base Damage and you add either Might or Dexterity, depending on the weapon.\\nFor example, Clubs deal 1d8 Damage and use Might as their Stat. So, if you have 3 Might, you will roll 1d8 + 3. If you roll 4 on the d8 and the target has 5 Defense, the final Damage is 4 + 3 - 5 = 2 Damage. The target takes 2 Damage.\\n\\nSome Spells are considered attacks, in which case they are \\"against Defense\\" (you subtract the target\'s Defense, normally, like you would with a weapon attack).\\nIf something does not mention it is an attack or is \\"against Defense\\", then you can assume it deals the Damage directly - what you roll is what you deal.\\n","Weapons":"As reported by many players, weapons in Call of Heroes are \\"cooler than in most RPG\'s\\".\\nEach Weapon has a special effect that makes it different from all other weapons.\\nSome weapons can land critical strikes, while others can deal more consistent Damage, heal you, ignore Defense, etc. Check out the Weapons page and choose your favorite!\\n","Abilities":"An Ability can either mean a Spell, a feature, a passive trait, etc. It\'s an all-encompassing word for \\"something you can do\\". Healing Word is an Ability and also a Spell. Action Surge is an Ability, but not a Spell. Highlander Technique is an Ability, but it\'s passive (it\'s always active).\\nAbilities are very straight forward, without much fodder text and extra noise.\\nAside from the name and marvelously illustrated icon, each Ability clearly states how many Actions it takes, its range, cost, etc.\\nAbilities that need disabmiguation have some extra notes attached at the bottom of the Ability box.\\n\\nMost spells do not have a verbal or material component requirement and can be cast just by using your hands. If you can\'t use your hands, you can\'t use Actions and thus you can\'t cast Spells. That\'s as simple as it gets!\\nThere are some exceptions to this, of course, but if it\'s an exception, you\'ll see it written explicitly in the Ability box.\\nTidbit - there is a type of Crowd Control called Silence that completely blocks the flow of magic of a caster and prevents all spells from being cast.\\n","Spell Casting Systems":"There are two equivalents to the Spell Slot mechanic of D&D: Mana and Cooldowns.\\n\\nAll Classes (spellcasters or not) use Mana to cast Abilities.\\nMana functions exactly like Spell Slots. However, in Call of Heroes, Spells are not categorised by levels.\\nInstead, each Spell costs a number of Mana points and a player\'s character has a certain number of Mana.\\nThus, if you have 5 Mana (that recovers on Long Rest), you can choose to spend 2 of it on a Spell that costs 2 Mana. You\'ll be left with 3 Mana for the rest of the Adventure.\\nYou can prepare a number of Spells from its available lists of Spells (Elemental, Conjuration, Divine, etc) and have them ready to cast. Most of the time, prepared Spells can be changed on Long Rests.\\nSome Spells do have a character Level requirements, though! Fire Ball is only usable by Level 4 or above characters!\\nPreparing Spells is simply called Knowing or Learning Spells.\\n","Cooldowns":"Cooldown is a term borrowed from video games. It refers to a time you must wait between casts. If a Spell has a cooldown of Long Rest, it means you can\'t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.\\nCooldowns are generally not based on time, but rather on checkpoints. Once per combat, once per Adventure, once per Turn, etc.\\n","Main Stat and Other":"The equivalent of Spellcasting Ability is the Main Stat.\\nThe Main Stat is the one used to determine your Spell DC (called Spell Grade) and it\'s equal to 6 + Main Stat.\\nIn the case of multiple Classes, you can choose between 2 options of Main Stats. If you can choose between Intelligence and Charisma but like Charisma more, feel free to use Charisma.\\nThe equivalent of Spell Attack Modifier is the Main Stat itself. But by default, there is nothing to take note of. If you need to add the Main Stat to something, it\'s explicitly written in the Ability text.\\n"}}');function fa(){Object.keys(ma).filter((function(e){return"default"!=e}));var e=ma["About The Game"],t=ma["CoH For D&D Players"];function a(e){var t=e.object,a=e.title;return(0,Ye.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(Wt,{children:a}),(0,Ye.jsx)("p",{children:t[a]})]})}function n(e){var t=e.object,n=e.title,o=e.children,i=e.type;return i=null==i?"normal":i,(0,Ye.jsxs)(bt,{type:i,children:[(0,Ye.jsxs)(wt,{children:[" ",(0,Ye.jsx)(a,{object:t,title:n})," "]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)(wt,{children:[" ",o," "]})]})}return(0,Ye.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Ye.jsxs)(Pt,{style:{whiteSpace:"pre-wrap"},title:"D&D Transition Guide",children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(At,{children:"About The Game"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)(bt,{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(wt,{children:(0,Ye.jsx)(a,{object:e,title:"What is Call of Heroes?"})}),(0,Ye.jsx)(wt,{children:(0,Ye.jsx)(a,{object:e,title:"Is this a D&D offspin?"})})]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)(Pt,{style:{whiteSpace:"pre-wrap",overflow:"hidden"},isSecondaryPage:!0,children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(At,{children:"Basic Rules Transition"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(n,{object:t,title:"D12 System",type:"lefty",children:(0,Ye.jsx)("img",{src:"/Rules/D12.png",style:{width:"55%",marginLeft:"22%",marginTop:"25%"}})}),(0,Ye.jsx)(a,{object:t,title:"Characters"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(n,{object:t,title:"Player Character Progression",children:(0,Ye.jsx)("img",{src:"/Rules/Talents.png",style:{width:"160%",marginLeft:"-15%"}})}),(0,Ye.jsx)(Wt,{children:"Character Stats"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("p",{children:t["Character Stats"].split("\n\n")[0]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)(bt,{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(wt,{children:"TODO"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(wt,{children:(0,Ye.jsx)("p",{children:t["Character Stats"].split("\n\n")[1]})})]}),(0,Ye.jsx)(a,{object:t,title:"Combat, Turns and Actions"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(a,{object:t,title:"Abilities"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(a,{object:t,title:"Spell Casting Systems"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(a,{object:t,title:"Main Stat and Other"})]})]})}function ga(e){if(null==e)throw new TypeError("Cannot destructure "+e)}var ya=JSON.parse('{"Template":{"Type":"Beast","Degree":"Normal","Experience":null,"Stats":null,"Health":null,"Armor":null,"Speed":null,"Initiative":null,"Abilities":[{"Attack":"1d12 Pierce"},{"Attack":{"Damage":"d12","EffectName":"miau"}}],"Passives":[{"Claw":"miau"}],"Avoids AoE":false,"Behavior":"None","Lore":"None","Suggested Obstacles":"None","Monster Data":"No tactic, mid HP, no gimmick","Role":"Main Enemy","Variants":"None","Story Ideas":"None","Valuable Loot":"None"},"Bannerman":{"Type":"Humanoid, Person","Experience":50,"Stats":"0/0/2/4/4","Health":13,"Speed":4,"Initiative":9,"Abilities":"None","Passives":[{"Inspiration":"All allies that can hear/see the Bannerman do +1 Damage with all attacks."}],"Avoids AoE":true,"Lore":"Bannermen are support Units that don\'t attack, but passively increase the Damage of all monsters.\\n","Behavior":"Bannermen avoid being attacked, but stay around the battlefield.\\nBannermen can be any race: Goblin, Koblod, Undead, Demons, etc. Be creative!\\n","Pair":"Pair with Guards, Bandits, etc.","Monster Data":"Kill me first","Role":"Support","Variants":"Koblod, Goblin, Undead, Demons"},"Goblin":{"Type":"Humanoid","Experience":75,"Stats":"-1/4/0/2/2","Health":20,"Speed":5,"Initiative":"4 Melee / 3 Ranged","Abilities":[{"Ranged":"1 + number of Goblins"},{"Melee":"1 + number of Goblins"}],"Passives":[{"Strength in Numbers":"Every Goblin attack deals +1 Damage for each Goblin fighting in their squad.\\nSo, even if a goblin is alone, it has +1.\\nWhen a Goblin dies or flees, it no longer counts as a fighting Goblin.\\n"},{"Darkvision":"Can see in the dark"}],"Avoids AoE":false,"Lore":"Goblins are Small Units that deal more damage the more Goblins there are.\\n","Behavior":"Attack random targets.\\nBe careful!

At close range (melee), it deals 1d4 + Might Damage. At up to 6 meters range, it deals 1d4 + Dexterity Damage.\\n\\nEvery Class gives you Training in at least one weapon category. The categories are 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 1-Handed Ranged, 2-Handed Ranged, Throwing Weapons and Shields.\\nIf you are trained in 1-Handed Melee weapons, it means you are Trained in Shortswords, Daggers, Punches, etc - anything that is 1-Handed.\\n\\nSome Races might give you Training in specific weapons (e.g. Guns) without giving you Training in the weapon category, though this is a rare occurance.\\n","How To Get Weapon Training":"Most Classes give you free Training in various weapons or weapon types.\\nYou can get Training in any weapon category by getting the Weapon Training Feat (see Feats).\\nFinally, you can get Training in any weapon by spending one Inspiration Point (see Inspiration).\\n","Thrown Weapons":"If you want to throw a weapon, it is considered an Improvised Attack (there\'s a Default Move Basic Ability called Improvised Attack).\\nThere exists a Feat called Throwing Expert that allows you to throw weapons without penalty.\\nYou still need to be Trained in that weapon to add your Might/Dexterity to the attack.\\n","Shield Training":"If you wear a Shield and you are not Trained in Shields, you do not benfit from the shield\'s extra Defense.\\n","Inspiration Training":"You can choose to spend 1 Inspiration Point to unlock Training in any Weapon Type (Shortswords, Longbows, Rapiers, Shields, etc).\\nInspiration Points are awarded by the Game Master for cool ideas, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Game Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.\\nSee the Inspiration page for more information.\\n","Swapping or Equipping Weapons":"At the start of your turn, you can freely choose what weapons to use or swap for the rest of your turn.\\nFor example, when your turn starts, you can choose to prepare one Shortsword and a Shield, or a Greatclub, or a Hand Crossbow and a Dagger.\\nYou can use these weapons however you like on your turn.\\nIf you ever want to swap weapons in the middle of your turn, you must spend a Half-Action.\\n\\nChanging weapons at the start of your turn is encouraged! Use different weapons to your advantage!\\n","Weapon Ranges":"Ranged weapons have a range specified. You can attack normally if you are within that range.\\nIf you attack from more than the weapon\'s range, the attack has a -2 penalty.\\nIf you attack from more than double the weapon\'s range, the attack has a -4 penalty.\\nYou can\'t attack further than that.\\n","Range":"To calculate the range from a Unit to another Unit, simply measure the distance from that Unit\'s space\'s center to the other Unit\'s space\'s center.\\nIf one of the Units is Large or larger, measure the distance from one of its outer-most spaces to the one of the other Unit\'s outer-most spaces (e.g. for Large Units - NOT to center, but to edge).\\n\\nAn easy way to measure this, if you\'re playing on a grid, is to count the number of squares from one Unit to another. If the other Unit is in a square right next to his Unit (even diagonally), the distance is 1 meter. If there\'s an empty square between them, the distance is 2. And so on.\\n","Aiming":"You can not aim for a specific area when attacking of using an Ability.\\nHowever, in niche cases, the GM might allow the use of the Aim Ability to aim at a specific point on the target (with consequences decided by the GM).\\n","Semi-Hitting With Area Abilities":"When playing on a grid, you might sometimes position an area Ability in such way that it hits half of a few squares.\\nFor example, you can position a 3x3 meter area in the center of a 4x4 meter zone; thus, the 4 squares in the middle will be fully covered by the 3x3 area, but the surrounding squares will all only be covered by a half of a square from the 3x3 area (or even a quarter).\\nThe Ability that does Damage or Crowd Control has Cover against semi-hit Units (and does -2 Healing for Healing Abilities).\\nIf the Ability does neither Damage nor Crowd Control nor Healing, it does not affect semi-hit Units.\\n\\nA Large Unit takes the full effect even if only one space (1x1 meter) of its total area is hit (e.g. hitting only a square of the 4 squares of a Large Unit applies the normal effect - does NOT semi-hit).\\n","Using Items":"Most items you can use in combat take a Half-Action to make (e.g. Scrolls, Potions, Caltrops, etc).\\nEven if a Spell normally takes 0 Actions, the scroll still takes a Half-Action to use. For example, if you have a Scroll of Smite, you must first land a weapon attack, then use the scroll to add the extra Damage (just like Smite says, but with a Half-Action).\\nThere might be situations in which using a Scroll is not feasible.\\n","Potions":"Consuming a Potion takes a Half-Action.\\n\\nEvery Unit can safely use at most one \\"Potion\\" per in-game hour. If a brew restores Health, Mana, Movement, etc (e.g. is not a lasting buff), it counts as a \\"Potion\\". Magical foods with similar properties count as Potions. The Game Master can choose to rule something as \\"not a Potion\\", which means it can be safely consumed, as per the item\'s rules.    \\nThe second Potion consumed per hour makes the Unit suffer of Exhaustion for 1 hour.\\nThe third and all further Potions consumed per hour make the user pass a Grade 12 Might Check or fall to 0 Health and fall in a coma (Unconscious) for 1 hour.\\n","Elixirs":"Consuming an Elixir takes a Half-Action.\\n","Scrolls":"A scroll is usually a piece of parchment that has a Spell infused in it. When used, the Scroll releases that Spell and the scroll destroyed. Scrolls are one-time use items.\\nUsing a Scroll takes a Half-Action.\\nYou don\'t need to be a spellcaster to use a Scroll, or expend Mana. Scrolls ignore cooldowns on your Abilities - they have nothing to do with your own Ability Cooldowns or Costs.\\n\\nWhen using a scroll, you use your own Stats for that Spell (e.g. Main Stat, Spell Grade, etc).\\nThe scroll Spell does not benefit from effect bonuses increased by your character\'s Levels or by Talents. It is simply a plain copy of a Spell.\\n\\nAs a Game Master, be careful with how you allow Players to buy scrolls from Shops. Players should not be able to buy all the scrolls they need and stock up on, say, 6 Fireball Scrolls they can just use on a whim.\\n","Inspiration Points":"In Call of Heroes, the Game Master can give a player an Inspiration Point for a cool idea, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Game Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.\\nGenerally, you can earn an Inspiration Point for impressing the Game Master or contributing well to the game. It\'s up to each Game Master to decide what impresses them and when to award an Inspiration Point.\\nInspiration Points are awarded individually. We recommend that the Game Master awards 1 to 2 Inspiration Points (total, not per player) every session.\\n","What Can I Do With Inspiration?":"Inspiration Points can be spent to improve your character or influence the tide of roleplaying.\\nYou can spend one Inspiration Point to gain Training in any one Weapon Type (Shortswords, Rapiers, Shields, etc) or gain one Proficiency Ability from the Proficiencies list.\\nYou can spend an Inspiration Point to also increase your Maximum Health by 1.\\nFinally, you can also spend one Inspiration Point to nudge a situation slightly in your favor or influence the outcome of a roleplaying situation. This is up to your creativity. For example, if the GM says you can\'t find a Blacksmith in a town, you could say \\"I want to use my Inspiration to actually find a Blacksmith\\". Or, for another example, if you fall down a ravine, you could say \\"I want to use my Inspiration to have remembered to tie a rope to myself before crossing this ravine\\". So, in theory, you could alter the past and the present. Use your creativity!\\nHowever, remember that the GM can refuse to allow you to use Inspiration in a way. Inspiration is meant to nudge the outcomes slightly, not alter whole timelines or create large-scale modifications to the present. Always ask the GM if you are allowed to use Inspiration this way.\\n","Movement":"Every Unit can move in combat. When you see the term \\"move\\", \\"moving\\", \\"Movement\\", etc, that always refers to walking, running, jumping, etc; moving never refers to making Actions (with your hands).\\n\\nOn your turn, you can move once a number of meters equal to your Speed.\\nYou can\'t split your Movement around Actions. You can move before or after attacking or casting a spell or doing any action, but once you move once, that\'s it! You can\'t move again until next turn! For example, you can\'t move 2 meters, take an Action (even if it\'s 0 Actions) and then move again.\\nNote that you can freely switch direction while moving, if it\'s in the same movement. If you want, you can move in one direction for a few meters, do a 180 degree turn and move back. That is valid movement, because it doesn\'t divide the movement around Actions, but it\'s still the same movement.\\n\\nHowever, there are several ways to break this rule. There are plenty of Abilities that allow you to \\"continue your movement\\".\\nAnother way to circumvent this is to get the Attack-Move Feat, which allows you to make Melee Attacks and cast non-offensive Spells \\"while moving\\".\\n","Other Movement":"Jumping takes away from Movement meters, whether vertical or horizontal.\\nSo, if you decide to jump 1 meter ahead, this still takes 1 meter of movement, as it normally would (the GM might make you roll a Check for succeeding the jump, though).\\nClimbing a 2 meter wall takes 2 meters out of your movement. If you are jumping both horizontally and vertically, you only use the movement for the horizontal movement (e.g. if you jump to a ledge 1 meter away that\'s 1 meter tall, this only uses 1 meter; similarly, if you are jumping to a ledge 3 meters away that\'s 2 meters tall, this takes only 3 meters out of your movement).\\n\\nIn some situations, Medium or Smaller Units might be able to fit through some squares of a certain Large or Large Unit (with GM\'s permission). For them, those squares count as Hard Terrain.\\n","Pushing":"Some Abilities \\"push\\" or \\"pull\\" Units (pulling is just pushing in the opposite direction).\\nPushing a Unit does not consume that Unit\'s movement.\\nPushing a Unit does not count as movement for that Unit (for the sake of \\"continuing movement\\").\\n","Adjacency":"Refers to all spaces within 1 meter of a Unit.\\n","Initiative":"Initiative determines the order in which Units take their turns in combat.\\n\\nA Player Character\'s Initiative Bonus is equal to (their Dexterity + their Charisma).\\n\\nTo determine turn order, at the start of a combat all Players roll 1d12 and add their Initiative Bonus to it.\\nMonster units don\'t roll,but instead have a fixed Initiative (e.g. 10, 8, 14, etc, depending on the monster).\\nUnits take their turns from the highest Initiative (rolled) to the lowest. The highest result goes first, the lowest goes last.\\n\\nIf there\'s a tie between a Player Unit and an enemy, the Player Unit goes before the monster (the Player Unit takes their turn first, and then the monster).\\nIf there\'s a tie between two Player Units, either can go before (they decide as a group).\\nIf there\'s a tie between two or more enemies, the GM decides which one goes before.\\n","Ranged or Melee Attacks":"Abilities usually specify if an attack is considered melee or ranged.\\nBut if it is not specified, apply the following:\\nAny attack with a melee weapon that is not thrown is considered a melee attack, even if it has longer range (e.g. 2 meters or 3 meters even).\\nAny attack with an Ability is considered melee if it has a range of 1 meter, otherwise it is considered a ranged attack.\\nIn any other cases, if the the range is 1 meter, or the object is not thrown but it has a longer range than 1 meter, it is considered a ranged attack.\\nRanged attacks (e.g. bows, spells) that are done at 1 meter range are still considered ranged attacks.\\n\\nRanged attacks done at 1 meter range have a -2 penalty.\\n","Resistance and Weakness":"Resistance to a certain Damage type means you only take 50% of that Damage (of the final Damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).\\nWeakness to a certain Damage type means you take 150% of that Damage (of the final Damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).\\nIf you have both Resistance and Weakness to something, they cancel out (so you take 100% of the Damage, as normal).\\nIf you have Resistance or Weakness twice, nothing extra happens (e.g. even if you have 2 Resistance and one Weakness to the same thing, you still take 100% Damage).\\n","Actions":"Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses both your hands (usually).\\nAn Action is typically associated with doing something with both hands.\\nYou can split an Action into two Half-Actions.\\n\\nThe term \\"Action\\" is just another word for \\"two Half-Actions\\".\\n\\nYou can\'t move, take actions (even if something takes 0 Actions) and then move again. There are, however, Abilities that circumvent this.\\n","Half-Actions":"Half-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.\\nEssentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).\\nAny Action is just two Half-Actions combined. The term \\"Action\\" is just another word for \\"two Half-Actions\\".\\n\\nYou want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That\'s 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that\'s simply the same as one Action.\\n\\nIf you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.\\n\\nYou don\'t actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn\'t matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.\\nHalf-Actions are not tied to one hand or the other in particular.\\n\\nYou CAN make 2 attacks with the same hand using 2 Half-Actions.\\nIf you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. The game\'s weapons and numbers are balanced around this.\\n\\nWhen your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that\'s exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you\'d be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon (e.g. Action Surge).\\n","Line of Sight":"If you can see a Unit directly, you have Line of Sight to it.\\n\\nTo clarify, if Unit A can see Unit B with their bare eyes, then Unit A has Line of Sight to Unit B.\\nIf Unit A can see even a little bit of the body of Unit B, then Unit A still has Line of Sight to Unit B (but attacks usually gain the Hard Cover pentalty if you can barely see the target).\\n\\nTo use an Ability, you need Line of Sight to the center target point of where you are casting the Ability.\\n\\nIf playing on a grid, if you target a point, you target the square that point is in. You can\'t normally target square intersections unless the Ability states you can.\\nIf you target a Unit, you must have line of sight to its square.\\nThere is Line of Sight from square A to square B if you can draw a line from any corner of square A to any corner of square B without any other Unit or Obstacle crossing the line.\\nHowever, other Units\' or obstacles\' squares can _intersect_ the line you were drawing if it\'s merely tangential, and does not pass from one side of the line to the other.\\nSee the example below.\\n\\nWithout magical means, Line of Sight is always 2-way. If Unit A has LoS to Unit B, then Unit B also has LoS to Unit A (assuming they look at one another).\\nTransparent solid objects (e.g. windows) do not block Line of Sight, but obviously missiles like arrows and magic bolts can\'t go through them. Apply common sense.\\n\\nAllies do not block Line of Sight, and neither do Enemies, but attacking a target behind an enemy provides them with Cover against the attack.\\n","Cover":"If the path from a Unit to another Unit is somewhat obstructed (e.g. by obstacles or other enemy Units), then the Unit targeted has Cover.\\nA Unit affected by something through Cover has +2 to all Checks and takes 2 less Damage from the source.\\n","Cooldown":"Some Abilities have a Cooldown.\\nCooldown refers to the time you must wait to use the Ability again.\\nAn Ability\'s Cooldown is represented by the _white hourglass_ icon. If an Ability has no such icon, then it has no Cooldown and can be used as often as you like.\\nA Cooldown of \\"Once / Adventure\\" means you can use the Ability ONCE, and then can\'t use it again until you finish the current Adventure.\\nA Cooldown mentioning time (e.g. 1 hour, 1 day, etc) always refers to in-game time, not real-life time. 1 day in game can pass instantly, if the Game Master says \\"one day passes\\", for example. Like in a book, movie or video game, time in-game passes from scene to scene, according to the adventure story.\\n","Triggering Abilities":"Some Abilities give you free uses of other Abilities. For example, Clerics get to cast Awe for free, even if it\'s on a Cooldown.\\nWhen an Ability tells you that you can \\"freely cast X ignoring its Cooldown/Cost\\", you can cast that Ability in that moment, whether it\'s on Cooldown or not.\\nIf it\'s not on Cooldown, the Ability does NOT go on Cooldown if you trigger a free cast like this.\\nIf it\'s on Cooldown, the Ability remains on Cooldown.\\n","Combat Grace Period":"For 10 minutes after finishing a combat encounter, all Units who participated are still considered in combat.\\nSome Abilities and game mechanics (e.g. Reserve Health) require you to be out of combat to use.\\nBe on your toes for a while after finishing a fight!\\n","Unit Sizes":"Medium and smaller Units occupy a 1x1 meter space.\\nLarge Units occupy a 2x2 meter space. It is up to the GM to tell how much space a Unit larger than Large occupies, and how well it can fit through gaps and units.\\nWhen moving a Large Unit (or larger), count the number of meters it moved from the center of its starting space to the center of its end space.\\n\\nIn some situations, Medium or Smaller Units might be able to fit through some squares of a certain Large or Large Unit (with GM\'s permission). For them, those squares count as Hard Terrain.\\n","Carrying Units":"A Unit carrying another Unit is Slowed (and might not be able to use its hands, depending on the situation).\\n","Mounted Combat":"Mounting or dismounting an Ally can be done normally with your Movement, by moving on its space, but that ends your Movement (unless you can Break your Movement; see rules for Breaking Movement).\\nMounts generally act on your turn and have their own movement.\\nA mounted Unit is Slowed, unless it specifically states that it\'s ridable.\\n\\nIf you want to mount an Enemy (e.g. a non-willing Unit), you must grapple it successfully with one Action - your Dexterity or Might Check versus its Dexterity of Might Check (you must match or get a higher number). If you succeed, you become mounted to that Unit for its next turn. Apply common sense to whether a mounted Unit can attack its rider (or whether the rider has Cover).\\n","Falling Damage":"Falling inflicts 1d6 True Damage for every 2 meters fallen (assuming you land on hard ground).\\nE.g. falling 3 meters deals 1d6 Damage, falling 4 meters deals 2d6 Damage, 5 meters - 2d6, 6 meters - 3d6, etc.\\nHaving someone fall on you deals the same True Damage to you as it does to the faller.\\nThe Game Master might reduce the Damage or mitigate it depending what you land on or if you fall onto an enemy with an attack. If you\'re a Game Master, consider halving the fall Damage if a Unit falls intentionately on another Unit to attack it.\\n","Unit":"Any alive person, monster or creature is considered a Unit.\\nInanimate objects can be considered Units only if and when you\'re targeting them directly with single-target attacks or Abilities.\\nThe GM has the final say in whether something is a Unit or not.\\n","Ally or Enemy":"A friendly Unit is considered an Ally. A hostile Unit is considered an Enemy.\\nInanimate Unit objects are considered neither Allies, nor Enemies.\\n","Worthy Enemies":"Certain Abilities specify that they only work against \\"Worthy Enemies\\".\\nA Worthy Enemy is a normal enemy that tries to kill you during a combat encounter only.\\nThe following are NOT considered worthy enemies:\\n- Defenseless Units (e.g. civillians, hunted deer, etc)\\n- Units that don\'t attack or don\'t want to attack\\n- Units killed in \\"time-skip combats\\" (quick combat, e.g. combats that happen without rolling initiative, or during roleplaying, etc)\\n- Every single creature in a swarm (e.g. a single bat is not a worthy enemy, but a Bat Swarm is a worthy enemy alltogether)\\n","Death and Being Fallen (0 Health)":"When reaching 0 Health, a Player Character becomes Fallen.\\nWhen Fallen, you skip your turn. You are not unconscious - you can still speak, see and hear, but you can not move your body.\\nYou can not have less than 0 Health.\\n\\n\\nWhen healed while Fallen, you get up and can do your turn, but you are Exhausted until the end of Combat.\\n\\nWhile Fallen, your Defense is 0, and if you take 5 or more Damage 5 times, your character dies.\\nThen, if you are healed and get up from being Fallen, these \\"times\\" you can take Damage reset (e.g. even if you took Damage 2 times, if you get up and then Fall again, you still need to take the Damage 5 times to die).\\n","Knowing and Learning Spells":"All Classes get access to some Basic Abilities. All these Abilities are in Basic Ability Lists (e.g. Arcane, Warfare, Nature, etc). Some Classes get access to some Basic Abilities, and some to other Basic Abilities, depending on categories (e.g. Mages get access to all Arcane and Elemental Spells, but no access to Nature Spells).\\nAll Classes can pick a few of these Basic Abilities to Learn for adventuring.\\nTo be able to cast an Ability (AKA to have that Ability) you need to Learn it inbetween Adventures. That becomes a Known Ability (you Know that Ability).\\nOnce you Learn an Ability, you Know it (obviously). When you see the term \\"Known Ability\\", it always refers to a Basic Ability from the Basic Ability Lists.\\n\\nMages, for example, can know a number of Ability of any kind from the ones that are available to them (e.g. any from the Elemental, Arcane, etc, but none from Nature, Divine, etc).\\nOnce Known, these Ability can be used as many times as the Cooldown and Cost allows (e.g. as long as you have enough Mana to cast it; explained later).\\nCheck out Mana Spellcasting to see how this works.\\n","Mana Spellcasting":"All Classes in the game use a system of points called Mana Points.\\nYou have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you start a new Adventure.\\n\\nThe amount of Mana a Spell costs to cast is represented by the _blue flame_ icon and the number near it.\\n\\nFor a clear example, let\'s take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points (and get 1 more total Mana every Level). Every Adventure, the Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.\\nEach Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn\'t specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don\'t have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can\'t.\\n\\nWhen building your character, you will have to choose a number of Basic Abilities from the ones available to your class (e.g. Ability Schools, like Elemental, Divine, Warfare, etc) - you can\'t have them all, there are dozens in the game! You\'ll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Basic Abilities. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 Abilities (total) from the Elemental, Conjuration and/or Arcane Lists. These will be all the Basic Spells you will be able to use until you finish the current Adventure.\\nYou pick these Abilities aside from your Class Abilities (e.g. Magic Mastery does not count among the 7).\\nCheck our your Class\'s available Ability Lists by going to your Class\'s page, at Spell Casting, under Basic Ability Lists. All Basic Abilities are on the Abilities page.\\nThis is explained in further detail later on (see Basic Ability Lists).\\n\\nYou can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points. Don\'t cheat!\\n","Cooldown-based Spellcasting":"DEPRECATED","Main Stat":"The Main Stat is what it sounds like: it is the primary Stat you will use for most things when using Abilities.\\nSome Abilities will say you have to add your Main Stat to its Damage.\\n\\nMost Classes allow you to pick which Stat you want your Main Stat to be, usually from Intelligence, Sense or Charisma.\\n","Spell Grade":"This is equal to your Main Stat + 6.\\nNot only players roll Checks, but also enemies. Some Abilities force enemies to roll a Check to avoid it.\\nWhen you make an enemy roll a Check, the Check must be equal or higher than your Spell Grade. If they do, they succeed; otherwise, they fail. An Ability tells you explicitly what happens on a success or failure.\\n","Basic Ability":"A Basic Ability refers to an Ability from the Basic Ability Lists (see Basic Ability Lists).\\nThey are called Basic because multiple Classes have access to them.\\n","Basic Ability Lists":"Aside from the Abilities you get from your Race and Class, there are also some Basic Ability Lists you have access to.\\nClasses have access to different Basic Ability Lists and can have a number of Basic Abilities chosen from them.\\n\\nA Basic Ability List is simply a list of Basic Abilities. A set of Basic Abilities grouped together based on their theme and category is called a Basic Ability List (themes like Elemental, Nature, Divine, etc).\\nThe text for every Ability is also in that list. Take a look at this page to familiarize yourself with them.\\n\\nAs of 2023, there are 10 Basic Ability Lists in the game: Bloodshed, Warfare, Elemental, Arcane, Nature, Conjuration, Mysticism, Faith, Eldritch and Divine. Clerics, for example, have access to the Conjuration and Divine Basic Ability Lists.\\nAlso, Clerics can have 4 + their Intelligence Basic Abilities from these lists (Conjuration and Divine).\\nClerics have access to the Conjuration and Divine Basic Ability Lists.\\nThis means that if you are a Cleric (and let\'s say your Intelligence is 2), you can pick 6 Spells from _any_ of those 3 Basic Ability Lists and have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.\\n","Known Basic Abilities":"Your Known Basic Abilities are very straightforward.\\nYour character can have that many Known Basic Abilities.\\nYou look at the Basic Ability Lists your class has access to (e.g. Clerics have access to the Conjuration and Divine Basic Ability Lists).\\nFrom all those Basic Abilities, you pick multiple of them and you have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.\\n\\nIf a Spell displays a blue flame icon and a number, then it costs that much Mana to cast it.\\n\\nThese spells represent what your Character has prepared for adventuring. They function exactly like Abilities you have. Inbetween Adventures, you can change what Spells from these Basic Ability Lists your Character knows.\\n","Known Basic Abilities (Cooldown-based)":"DEPRECATED","Relearning Spells":"All Classes can unlearn and re-learn their Basic Abilities inbetween Adventures.\\nTalents can also be swapped inbetween Adventures.\\n","Spell Level Requirements":"Some Abilities require your character to be at least of a certain Level in order to Learn.\\nFor example, if a Spell \\"Requires Level 4\\", your character must be Level 4 or higher to be able to Learn that Ability.\\n","Free Spells":"You will see that some Basic Spells have no cost and no cooldown.\\nThe only \'cost\' of these Spells is a space in your Known Basic Abilities.\\nAs a general rule of thumb, the effect of most free Spells dissipates immediately if you ever no longer Know that Spell. A Game Master might allow exceptions to this.\\n","Multiracing and Multiclassing":"Multiracing and Multiclassing in Call of Heroes is done by picking a base Race/Class, and supplementing it with a Multirace (MR) or Multiclass (MC) Feat (e.g. everyone starts with a free Feat they can pick, and get one more Feat at Levels 4 and 8). You can find all of these in the Feats list.\\nNaturally, you can\'t pick the Multirace Feat for your base Race or the Multiclass Feat for your base Class.\\nAll of these Feats will require you to sacrifice something from your character permanently, like your Maximum Health, Maximum Mana, and so on.\\n","Spell Components and Hands":"Most spells do not require physical components or spoken words. However, it is intended that all Spells require the use of at least one hand, even the ones that cost 0 Actions or a Reaction (though it does not matter if the hand is occupied by a weapon). This is relevant if, for example, the user has its hands tied behind its back in a roleplay encounter.\\nPassive Spells are always active, no matter if the user is Silenced or has its hands tied.\\n","Dice calculations":"To denote multiple dice of the same type rolled at the same time, you will see a number in front of the \\"d\\", like \\"2d4\\" or \\"5d6\\". That simply means \\"two 4-sided dice\\" or \\"five 6-sided dice\\". If something tells you to roll \\"5d6\\", roll five 6-sided dice all at the same time, and sum up the result!\\nSometimes, you will also need to roll multiple dice of multiple types, like \\"2d8 + 3d12\\". That means you must roll two 8-sided dice and three 12-sided dice all at the same time and sum up the result.\\nYou might also see other \\"modifiers\\" to dice rolls, such as \\"+ 3\\" or \\"- 1\\". That simply means you add 3 to the total number, or subtract 1 from the total number. So, such an example might be \\"2d6 + 2\\" or \\"2d4 + 3d10 - 5\\". Roll all those dice and add or subtract the number mentioned.\\nIn other cases, you will see other modifiers like \\"+ your Might\\" or \\"+ your Dexterity\\". These are usually self explanatory - they refer to adding your character\'s Might or your character\'s Dexterity to the final number. Such an example might be \\"2d6 + your Might\\". In this case, you roll 2d6 and add your character\'s Might to the final result.\\n","Checks":"To pass a Check, your rolled total must be equal or higher than the required number.\\nCheck difficulty varies depending on the task.\\nCertain non-Resist Checks can be performed multiple times until success (usually physical tasks). However, many non-Resist Checks may not be repeated (e.g. it doesn\'t make sense to try to roll an Intelligence Check again to see if you know about vampires).\\n\\nRolling a 12 on a Check is a critical success, and it counts as 15.\\n","Leveling Up":"In Call of Heroes, there are 10 Player Character Levels (from 1 to 10). Most characters start as Level 1 characters and progress level by level towards Level 10.\\nEach Level, a character gains some Reserve Health (based on Class) and extra resources, like maximum Mana, extra available Spells, Feats, Stats, etc.\\nEvery 2 Levels, characters also gain a Talent from their Class - these are usually strong Abilities that define how you play your character.\\n\\nThere are 2 ways in which PC\'s can level up: either through gaining Experience from killing monsters, completing tasks and puzzles, roleplaying, etc _or_ by milestones set by the Game Master. It is up to each GM to use a system that fits their own adventure\\n\\nThe milestone system is the recommended system for most adventures, as it\'s easier to work with and more thematic.\\nIf you are using the milestone system, the Game Master will simply decide that all players level up when the GM thinks the time is right. This is generally after a boss fight or after an important story event.\\nIn the milestone system, there are no Experience Points.\\n\\nLeveling up can\'t happen during combat, but it is delayed to after combat.\\nUpon Leveling Up, the GM might have the Player Characters instantly replenish their resources (e.g. heal to full Health, regain Mana, reset Cooldowns, etc).\\nAs a variant rule, the Game Master can decide to not have the characters Level Up immediately after reaching the Experience threshold, but when the current Adventure is finished.\\n","The Experience System":"In the Experience system, a Player needs an amount of Experience Points to Level Up. Each Player has a separate track of Experience Points, but it is recommended that Game Masters award Experience Points equally, so that all players Level Up at the same time.\\nOnce a player Levels Up their character, their Experience Points are spent, but they keep extra Experience they didn\'t spend. For example, if a Player has 500 Experience Points and they need 450 to Level Up, they Level Up and they keep 50 Experience. After that, they need to \\"fill up the Experience meter\\" again to Level Up.\\n\\nThe amount of Experience Points required to Level Up to the next level is equal to (next level) * 100. To Level Up from Level 1 to Level 2, you need 200 Experience Points. Then, to Level up from Level 2 to Level 3, you need 300 more Experience Points. And so on.\\n\\nNote: If you\'re coming from other RPG\'s, note that how much Experience you need to get from a Level to another does NOT refer to ALL the Experience your character has amassed so far. From Level 1 to 2, you need 200 Experience. And from Level 2 to 3 you need 300 _more_ Experience. The total amount of Experience needed for you to be Level 3 is 500. So, no, you obviously don\'t need just 100 Experience to Level up every time.\\n","Distributing Experience":"When the players as a group defeat an enemy that awards Experience, distribute that Experience evenly among all players who took part.\\nIf a monster was worth 200 Experience and there are 4 party members, then each party member gets 50 Experience. Monsters don\'t have levels in CoH, but rather each monster awards experience.\\n\\nThe Game Master will usually announce how much Experience an encounter was worth. The GM can also award Experience for other tasks, such as getting out of a situation, solving puzzles, completing a part of the storyline, etc.\\n","LevelUpBonusesDescription (Cooldown-based)":"DEPRECATED","LevelUpBonusesDescription (Mana-based)":"When you level up (e.g. Level 1 to Level 2), you gain some Health (depending on your Class) and you can Know one more Ability from your allowed Basic Ability Lists.\\nYour Maximum Mana increases by 1.\\nDepending on your Level, you also gain something else (see the table on the left).\\n\\nNote that you do not add your Might to your total Health every Level!\\n\\nOnce you reach Level 6, you unlock the Action Surge Ability.\\n","LevelUpBonusesDescription (Special Mana-based)":"When you level up (e.g. Level 1 to Level 2), you gain some Health (depending on your Class) and you can Know one more Ability from your allowed Basic Ability Lists.\\nUnlike regular Classes, Warlocks don\'t gain a Mana point every Level, but rather every 3 Levels (check the table to see when you get extra Mana!).\\nDepending on your Level, you also gain something else (see the table on the left).\\n\\nNote that you do not add your Might to your total Health every Level!\\n\\nOnce you reach Level 6, you unlock the Action Surge Ability.\\n","Adventure":"An Adventure is a period of gameplay defined by the GM. An Adventure could be one full dungeon, one quest, one session, or just one day outdoors adventuring.\\nThere is no concept of \\"long resting\\" in Call of Heroes - you only regain spent resources inbetween Adventures.\\n","Reserve Health Pool":"Equal to half of your Maximum Health, without buffs, rounded down.\\n\\nReserve Health is, well, Health that you have in reserves. When not in combat, you can instantly transfer Health from your Reserve Health to your regular Health (e.g. take points from your Reserve Health to heal your Health for the same amount).\\nHealing from your Reserve Health can only be done 10 minutes after a combat encounter ends.\\n","Shielding":"Shielding is just extra \\"Health\\" on top of your normal Health. Shielding can exceed your maximum Health. For example, if you have 20 Health and 5 Shielding, and you take 9 Damage, you will be left with 16 Health.\\nGenerally, Shielding last for a short time, then whatever is left of the Shielding disappears. For example, if you gain 10 Shielding which lasts for 1 minute, and you take 5 Damage, you will have 5 Shielding remaining. After 1 minute, the Shielding expires and you will have 0 Shielding.\\nShielding can stack (e.g. from 2 Abilities). For example, if you use an Ability that gives you 10 Shielding and then use another Ability that gives you 5 Shielding, you wll have 15 Shielding.\\nHowever, when one of the Shielding disappears, it tries to disappear for the full amount - if you gained 10 Shielding, you lose 10 Shielding when it expires. For example, if you gain 10 Shielding for an hour and 5 Shielding for 1 minute, then you take 8 Damage, this leaves you at 7 Shielding. Then, after 1 minute, the 5 Shielding disappears and leaves you at 2 Shielding.\\nAs another example, if you gain 5 Shielding for an hour and 10 Shielding for 1 minute, then you take 8 Damage, this leaves you at 7 Shielding; when the 10 Shielding expires, you will be left at 0 Shielding.\\nSimply put: if you gain Shielding and the Shielding expires, you lose as much Shielding as you gained. There is no \\"priority\\" for Shielding absorption - Shielding is Shielding. What you gain is what you lose when it expires.\\nYou never lose Health when Shielding expires.\\n","Exhaustion":"An Exhausted Unit is Dazed and Slowed indefinitely.\\n\\nExhaustion does not last just 1 turn, but until cured.\\nExhaustion from being Fallen is automatically cured at the end of the combat encounter.\\nOtherwise, Exhaustion is cured upon sleeping for 8 hours.\\n\\nYou can also become Exhausted if you go more than 24 hours without sleep, from overdosing on potions or from magical effects.\\n\\nSince you are already Dazed and Slowed, being Dazed or Slowed again has no effect.\\n"}');function wa(){var e=ye(),t=decodeURIComponent(e.hash).substring(1);return(0,Ye.jsxs)(Pt,{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(Ct,{children:t}),(0,Ye.jsx)("p",{children:ba[t]}),"Line of Sight"==t&&(0,Ye.jsxs)(bt,{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(wt,{children:(0,Ye.jsx)("img",{style:{width:"100%"},src:"/Rules/LineOfSightWall.png"})}),(0,Ye.jsx)(wt,{children:(0,Ye.jsx)("img",{style:{width:"100%"},src:"/Rules/LineOfSightNo.png"})})]}),"Checks"==t&&(0,Ye.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(Wt,{children:"Standard Check Difficulty"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)(pa,{columns:["Difficulty","Number Needed To Succeed"],children:[(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Easy"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"5"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Medium"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"10"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Hard"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"15"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Very Hard"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"20"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Impossible"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"25"})]})]})]})]})}var Aa=JSON.parse('{"Before Adventuring":"You have not started adventuring yet.

Draconic can be spoken by non-dragons, but never properly, as non-dragons lack dragon breath and the instincts necessary to manifest it perfectly. There exists a version of written Draconic, at the sight of which dragons and Dragonborn can feel the language as if it were spoken. Draconic is usually not written with words, but rather with pictograms or symbols that aim to directly stir an emotion when seen by a Dragonborn or dragon.\\n\\nThe standard Special Languages are:\\n- Thieves\' Cant\\n- Druidic (wind, trees, etc)\\n- Draconic (shouts, breath, short words); not able to be spoken properly by non-dragons"}');function Da(){var e=Object.keys(xa);return(0,Ye.jsx)(Pt,{title:"Languages",children:e.map((function(e){return(0,Ye.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(Wt,{children:e}),(0,Ye.jsx)("p",{children:xa[e]})]})}))})}var Ca=function(){return(0,Ye.jsxs)(pa,{type:"info",columns:["Level","You Get..."],children:[(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 1"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"-"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 2"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Class Specialization"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 3"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Class Talent (Tier 1)"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 4"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("td",{children:["+1 in any Stat (up to +4)",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{}),"1 Feat"]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 5"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Class Talent (Tier 2)"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 6"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Action Surge (see below)"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 7"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Class Talent (Tier 3)"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 8"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("td",{children:["+1 in any Stat (up to +5)",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{}),"1 Feat"]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 9"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Class Talent (Tier 4)"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 10"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Ultimate Class Ability"})]})]})},Ea=function(){return(0,Ye.jsxs)(pa,{type:"info",columns:["Level","You Get..."],children:[(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 1"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"-"})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 2"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("td",{children:["Class Specialization",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{}),"1 Extra ",(0,Ye.jsx)(Ue,{name:"Mana"}),"Mana"]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 3"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("td",{children:["Class Talent (Tier 1)",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{})]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 4"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("td",{children:["+1 in any Stat (up to +4)",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{}),"+1 Feat",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{})]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 5"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("td",{children:["Class Talent (Tier 2)",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{}),"1 Extra ",(0,Ye.jsx)(Ue,{name:"Mana"}),"Mana"]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 6"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("td",{children:["Action Surge (see below)",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{})]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 7"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("td",{children:["Class Talent (Tier 3)",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{})]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 8"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("td",{children:["+1 in any Stat (up to +5)",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{}),"+1 Feat",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{}),"1 Extra ",(0,Ye.jsx)(Ue,{name:"Mana"}),"Mana"]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 9"}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("td",{children:["Class Talent (Tier 4)",(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{}),(0,Ye.jsx)("br",{})]})]}),(0,Ye.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 10"}),(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:"Ultimate Class Ability"})]})]})};function Pa(e){var t=e.name,a=e.theRaceOrClass,n="All Classes get a number of extra Proficiencies.

Commonfolk might feel in danger, but you know better, for judging a Davel\'s personality is as easy as looking for clear physical traits. This one\'s horns form a halo, and its eyes are a glowing white not for magic nor disease, but due to its devotion to the light.\\nDavels are demon people, but their ancestry can be traced back Fey demons, underground demons, or even originating from unspeakable realms. Demonic as they might be, Davels are not necessarily evil, but their looks shift according to their beliefs and what drives them in life. A warrior Davel might have his horns turn ram-like, and have his nose flatten to look more like a bull, with a shorter, bulkier tail. Similarly, a depressed Davel\'s hair might turn gray and straight, and horns might start pointing downward, while a druid Davel\'s horns might start to resemble the horns of a stag, with their tails\' ends resembling a leaf. Their lifespan also depends on their beliefs and morals; a Davel driven by meditation and peace will live considerably longer, while a Davel dark mage\'s lifespan will be significantly shorter.\\nSociety is driven by lies and deception, and while Davels know that, it poses a challenge for Davels to lie.

Clal of Heroes can be seen as a better alternative to Dungeons and Dragons, with more player-friendly (and clearly written) rules, mechanics that area easier to understand, more intriguing options and digitally modern. Described directly, it\'s cleverly simple, modern and plainly cool! Like the games it draw inspiration from, Call of Heroes is a combat-oriented game. While optional, fighting is a key part of Call of Heroes. It is one aspect that Call of Heroes excels at over its alternatives: combat is faster, more dynamic and more interesting overall, with simpler rules, but more possibilities for strategies and tactics. Combat usually happens on a grid of squares, with every player and monster taking turns to move, attack and cast magic spells!\\nUnlike RPG video games (World of Warcraft, Skyrim, etc), in tabletop RPG\'s, a Game Master can create any world and story they want (based on some rules) and players can essentially do anything they want in that world or story, without being limited to narrow dialogue options or only certain mechanics.\\nIn a tabletop RPG, the players can do _anything_ (or at least try)! It becomes the Game Master\'s responsibility to narrate what happens, play the role of non-player characters and monsters, come up with fair encounters and make the experience fun for the players. Having fun is the most important!\\nThe Game Master is not the player\'s enemy - it is the narrator, referee and, usually, host of the game; their goal is to provide exciting experiences and stories for the players and keep the game balanced and impartial.\\n\\nA tabletop RPG is not constrained by graphics. A lot of people play on a table, with grids/mats and miniatures as characters (like in a board game). But this is not entirely necessary! Many people play without any visual aid at all, and it\'s all \\"theater of the mind\\"!\\nNowadays, there are online platforms to play tabletop RPG\'s. These offer the Game Master tools for creating maps, \\"tokens\\" that represent player characters and enemies (like 2D sprites or even 3D models that can be placed on the map) and even playing environmental music.\\nAnd like in a board game, there are rules for both players and the Game Master to ensure that the game is fair and fun for everyone. Every player\'s character must have strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nWhen players want to do something, like shooting a bow or negotiating with an NPC, the result is often determined by rolling dice.\\n","How do groups work?":"If you want to play, sometimes it\'s as easy as creating a character outside of a game, finding a group to play with via an online platform and just joining the game.\\nHowever, tabletop RPG\'s can be so much more than just a one-time experience!\\n\\nMany GM\'s choose to run \'campaigns\', which is a series of game sessions that continue from one play session to another, and expand into an overarching story and develop the players\' characters\' personalities and powers.\\nThus, if you want it to be a more intricate experience, you should find a group that fits you; make sure you get on well with everyone else and everyone is on the same page when it comes to playing.\\n\\nEach GM is different. A GM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some GM\'s have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.\\nUltimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously. If you find a group, make sure you ask what kind of group they are.\\n\\nMost groups have one Game Master and between 3 and 6 other players who play as individual characters.\\nThe recommended sweet spot for Call of Heroes is one Game Master and 4 to 5 other players.\\n\\nA play session can last as long as the group desires. Usually, you should dedicate at least 1:30 to 2 hours to a play session. A lot of players find they want to keep going after that, since time flies fast when you\'re having fun and making progress through the story!\\n","How is it different from a board game?":"A board game is limited by its physical pieces (cards, miniatures, board, etc).\\nA tabletop RPG does not have to be limited by anything.\\nWhen you buy a board game, you expect to be able to play the whole game with everything that comes in the box.\\nHowever, to play Call of Heroes, you don\'t need anything from the box. In fact, you don\'t even need to buy anything! Don\'t want to buy mats or print out maps? Use sheets of paper and draw the board on them directly. Don\'t have miniatures? Use pretzels and bottle caps (sounds stupid, but it works; and we\'re also pretty sure you can find better replacements for them as well).\\nThere is no stigma in the tabletop roleplaying community for improvizing your own gaming set. In fact, it\'s encouraged! Many people like making terrain and props to use in their tabletop games.\\n","What is a story or adventure like?":"Slay monsters, get treasure\\nThe 3 pillars (33% each)\\n","What should I buy to get started?":"Nothing.\\nAll you need to play are the rules and, of course, a group of people.\\nAll the rules for the players are free and accessible online on this website.\\nWe do, though, recommend you get a set of D&D Dice (it contains a 4-sided die, 6-sided die, 8-sided die, 10-sided die, 12-sided die and 20-sided die). Rolling dice is a very fun aspect of tabletop RPG\'s! However, if you don\'t have access to a set of dice, there are plenty mobile or online apps that simulate dice rolling. You should be able to buy a generic set of such dice for a maximum of $10 at a gaming store (as of 2022).\\n","How do I get started?":"It might be daunting to learn all the rules by yourself. But fret not; since Call of Heroes is mainly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, you fill find a lot of people who play D&D and will be willing to try CoH with you!\\nThe easiest way to get started is to find someone who already knows how to play Call of Heroes and ask to join their game, or ask them to host a game for you and some other friends.\\nIf you want to try Call of Heroes specifically and you have experience with Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition or One D&D), see the page \\"D&D to CoH transition guide\\". It will provide you an easy introduction to Call of Heroes from a D&D perspective.\\nIf you never played a tabletop RPG but you have friends who have played Dungeons and Dragons, send them a link to the \\"D&D to CoH transition guide\\" page!\\nIf you decide to play online, there are several platforms for playing Call of Heroes that simulate real life tables with miniatures, dice, music, etc. As of 2023, the most popular such platform is Roll20 (https://roll20.net). It is free for all players and Game Masters alike and supports many roleplaying games, including Call of Heroes.\\n","Learning the Rules":"Feel free to follow this guide to learn how to play the game. Both in the book and on the official website, you will find clarifications for each and every rule. When in doubt, search it up on the website or consult the table of contents of the book for that rule.\\nAside from this written guide, there is also a video guide for both new and experienced roleplayers on our official YouTube channel or on the official Call of Heroes website.\\n\\nTo be a player in a game, you need a Character! Don\'t worry about creating a character for now.\\nFor the rest of this guide, assume you are playing as a short and skinny, sneaky Gnome. That is your character! We\'ll name him Don. Yes, in this story, you are Don.\\n","Checking the Rules":"If you ever find something ambiguous, there is probably a rule for it on the official website. Just search the exact phrase or words that are unclear and you will most likely find an explanation!\\n","Dice":"Before we begin, you need to know about dice.\\nDice rolling is a core component of Call of Heroes. Whatever you want to do, it is likely you will need to roll a die for it to determine if you succeed or fail, either as a Player Character or as an NPC or monster.\\nIn the world of tabletop roleplaying, there exists one standard set of \\"polyhedral\\" dice - whether they are Dungeons and Dragons dice or Pathfinder dice, they are all the same and they all work.\\nA set of such dice contains 7 special dice: a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, two 10-sided dice, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die. Only one such set will suffice for playing Call of Heroes to its full extent, though the more dice you have, the merrier!\\nEach of these dice contains one number on each face: the 4-sided die goes from 1 to 4, the 6-sided die (normal die) goes from 1 to 6, and so on.\\nWherever you live, you can buy a set of roleplaying dice for less than $10 (as of 2023), usually at a board game shop or a gaming store, or, if you can\'t find any, you can order them online. If you can\'t afford that, there are plenty of mobile dice simulators. Just search \\"dice\\" on your mobile application store and there should be several free applications that mimick dice rolling!\\nIf you decide to play online and not at a real table, however, you don\'t need to buy dice and can just use online dice rolling simulators. There are many platforms for online roleplaying and they all incorporate dice rolling simulators.\\n","Dice notation and calculations":"Whenever you see a notation like \\"d4\\", \\"d6\\", \\"d8\\", etc, these mean \\"4-sided die\\", \\"6-sided die\\", \\"8-sided die\\", etc.\\nSo, a die with 4 sides is called a \\"d4\\", a die with 6 sides is called a \\"d6\\", etc. \\nIf you see \\"d4\\", that means you\'re supposed to roll a 4-sided die and take that result.\\nIf you see \\"d6\\", that means you\'re supposed to roll a 6-sided die and take that result. And so on and so forth.\\n\\nIf you are ever in doubt about what a certain dice notation means, you can ask your other team mates or the Game Master - one of them will surely know!\\n\\nCall of Heroes is a \\"d12 system\\", unlike Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, which are \\"d20 systems\\". This simply means that you will use the d12 die for _a lot_ of things in Call of Heroes. The 12-sided die will be your best friend while playing Call of Heroes, so learn which one it is! Frankly, we believe it is also the prettiest die of them all! Just look at that perfect shape... beautiful!\\n","How does it play out?":"Here is how a standard game session plays out:\\nWhen everyone sits down at the table and is ready to start playing, the Game Master will start telling you how the story begins. This is usually narration in the 2nd person, addressing you all at the same time.\\n\\"You are all sitting around a camp fire, deep in the woods. It is a cool Autumn day and the sky is clear of clouds. You are surrounded by thick shrubbery and your shadows dance as the flame flickers\\".\\nYou and your fellow players can choose to do, well, anything, at any point during the story. However, you should refrain from interrupting the Game Master while they are talking. Generally, you can ask the Game Master for any more information you think you need, and the Game Master might or might not tell you, depending on the story they are telling.\\nHowever, a clear sign that you _can_ do something is if the Game Master says \\"what do you do?\\". That is your time to shine as a team.\\n\\"Suddenly, a bear appears out of the thicket. What do you do?\\"\\nAnd there is no correct answer. You, together, as a team, decide what you want to do. Do you want to scare off the bear? Do you run? Do you hide? Do you want to shoot an arrow at it? Do you want to cast a magic spell at it and set it on fire? Do you want to do... nothing? Of course, each of you can do something different if you have different opinions on what the best course of action is, but, fundamentally, you are all in this together.\\nIf you want to do something, simply say it out loud! \\"I want to hide from the bear\\" or, more directly, \\"I hide from the bear\\" (generally, when a player says \\"I\\" or \\"Me\\", they refer to their character; if you don\'t feel comfortable using \\"I\\", use \\"my character\\", like \\"My character wants to hide\\" or \\"I want my character to hide\\"). Or, you could ask the Game Master clarification questions like \\"Does my character know the bear\'s intentions?\\" or \\"Do I see other bears in the darkness?\\". Situations might hide secrets!\\nThis repeats on and on: the Game Master describes a situation, and you all decide how to resolve that situation. Usually, the Game Master has prepared in advance your possibilities, but, a lot of the time, the Game Master\'s job is to improvise and know how to deal with whatever the players decide they want to do. Being a good GM takes a lot of practice and time invested, but it is worth it!\\n\\nNormally, there is no \\"turn order\\" in which players do things. Anyone can do anything at any point in time. Nonetheless, the GM might impose an order in which each player can say what they want to do, to keep everything organized.\\nHowever, there _is_ a turn order when it comes to fighting! If the players engage in a battle to the death, there will be an order in which everyone can say what they want to do! But more on that later.\\nFor now, we\'re concerned with this bear that\'s appeared near our campfire.\\n\\nYou want to _do something_. Will you succeed?\\n","Checks":"So, you want to _do something. How do you determine if your character succeeds or fails at it?\\nWhenever you (your character) want to do something that requires some effort, that will usually require you to make roll Check.\\nA Check is a d12 die roll - you roll a 12-sided die to determine how well you do. If you get a 1, 2 or 3, that is usually pretty bad, while 10, 11 or 12 are pretty good numbers and have a higher chance to succeed.\\nYou as the player don\'t know how high you have to roll to succeed - the Game Master knows it, though, and you must trust that they are playing it fairly.\\nWhether you fail or succeed, the Game Master will let you know what happens! The GM might say \\"You try to hide behind a tree, but the bear\'s keen sense of smell detects where you are\\" if you fail, or \\"You successfully hide behind a tree, without the bear noticing\\" if you succeed.\\nWhenever not sure what you can do, ask the GM!\\n\\nHowever, how well you do is not all completely random. Naturally, a short, skinny Gnome should be better at hiding than most, and a bulky barbarian should normally be better at lifting heavy objects than most.\\nThat is where your character\'s stats come in!\\n","Stats":"Each Character\'s has 5 Stats: Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Sense and Charisma.\\nTogether, they represent your Character\'s capabilities. When you create your character, each of them will range from -1 to 3, but they are generally balanced so you have some higher Stats and some lower Stats.\\nStats are just some numbers that represent how good your character is at that particular thing. Having -1 in a Stat means you are below average at that (yikes!), having 0 or 1 in a Stat means you (your character) are average and having 2 or 3 means you are above average or great at it!\\n\\nMight refers to how physically strong the character is and how much physical effort and pain the character can endure. If you have 0 Might, it means your character is pretty average at physical strength.\\nDexterity refers to how agile the character is, how good its reflexes are, how well it can maintain balance, etc. If you have 3 Dexterity, you are _really_ agile, and really good at those things!\\nIntelligence refers to how many things the character knows, how well it does with magic and how good their memory is. If you have -1 Intelligence, it means the character is (no offense) fairly dumb.\\nSense refers to how good your 5 senses are, how strong your willpower is, and how keen your intuition is.\\nA 1 in Sense means you have average senses and willpower.\\nCharimsa refers to how well you do in social situations, both verbally and with body language. A 2 in Charisma means you are a good communicator and people usually like you!\\n","Checks Continued":"Let\'s get back to Checks. Whenever you make a Check, you add one of the appropriate Stats to the d12 roll.\\nSo, if you want to hide, that fits with the Dexterity Stat, so you roll a d12 and add your Dexterity to that. If you are the short, skinny and sneaky Gnome and your Dexterity is 3, you roll a d12 and add 3 to the result. That is the result of your Check.\\nThe Game Master will usually tell you what Stat to use for a certain Check.\\n\\nOnly the Game Master knows how high the result of your Check has to be to succeed, but, as a general rule of thumb, most medium to difficult tasks will require you to get at least a 10 (with the d12 + the Stat).\\n\\nThose are all the rules for regular Checks! But if you are a maths-savy person, you will notice that even if you have the highest number in a Stat, that is still only a 50% chance to succeed. So, to combat this, there are plenty of special Abilities that allow you to add more numbers to Checks - in some special cases, you can get even up to +15 to Checks!\\nDon\'t worry about it for now. Call of Heroes is very straight-forward. If you can add more numbers to a Check, you will see it explicitly written on something your Character can do.\\nBut there are no other general rules for Checks. Unless you see an exception explicitly written on your Character\'s sheet, that\'s all you need to know for Checks!\\n","Combat":"If you decide to engage in combat (or the enemies ambush you), the way things play out change slightly.\\nTactical combat is a large part of what makes Call of Heroes unique and an improvement over other systems.\\nIn combat, you can no longer make decisions whever you want, but you have to take them on your turn. Combat in all RPG\'s play more similarly to a board game in which you have more freedom.\\nFirst things first, let\'s talk about the turn order.\\n","Turn order (and Initiative)":"Turn order is determined by rolling a d12 and taking turns in order from the highest to the lowest.\\n\\nLet\'s say you are 4 players, and are ambushed by 3 bears. You can\'t just say \\"I shoot an arrow at the bear\\" and do it immediately. You must respect the turn order, because maybe the bears are faster than you!\\nBut how do you determine the order in which everyone acts? By rolling a d12, of course!\\n\\nTo determine combat turn order, every player rolls for \\"Initiative\\", meaning you roll a d12 and add your Dexterity and your Charisma to the roll.\\nSince your Dexterity is 3 and your Charisma is 2 (as the short sneaky Gnome that you are), that means you roll a d12 and add 5 to the result. That\'s pretty good!\\n\\nEveryone takes their turn in order of how high they rolled. Whoever rolled the highest goes first.\\nIn Call of Heroes, monsters and non-placed characters don\'t roll for Initiative, but instead just have a number. Bears, for example, have 10 Initiative by default.\\n\\nSo, if you roll above 10, you go before the bears.\\nSince bears all have the same initiative, they take their turns one by one, one after another (or, if the GM decides so, they could take their turns all at the same time).\\n\\nAfter everyone rolls for Initiative, it\'s time to fight (in order of initiative).\\nEveryone (and the bears) take turns to do what they want to do, and then again and again until combat is over (AKA all enemis die, all players die, you run away, you negotiate a truce, etc).\\n","Ambushing":"Sometimes, one or multiple Units will sneak upon another group to try to ambush them.\\nWhen a Unit is ambushing, the combat starts; everyone rolls Initiative, but the ambushing Unit(s) hax maximum initiative. Everyone else follows the normal rules for Initiative.\\n\\nApply common sense when someone is Ambushing. For example, if a Rogue makes a Dexterity Check to stealthily get close to the enemies and succeeds, they might be able to say \\"I want to attack them!\\". Then the combat starts and the Rogue goes first.\\nAmbushing can also happen when the enemies do not expect an attack (e.g. you are talking calmly to an NPC and suddenly attack it).\\nNote that if the enemies are prepared or expecting an attack, then it\'s not am ambush anymore. If you suddenly decide to attack an NPC you are talking to, use normal Initiative rules.\\nSometimes it\'s tricky to tell if it\'s an ambush or not - it is up to the GM to determine if something counts as an ambush.\\n","Health":"How much you can resist in combat is determined by your Health Points. Every living thing in the game has Health Point (or just Health, or HP).\\nYou as a character have a set amount of Health Points determined by how you created your character.\\n\\nWhenever you take Damage, you subtract that many points from your current Health Points.\\nIf someone reaches 0 or less Health Points, they die (or at least fall incapacitated).\\nProtect these Health Points as best you can, because they represent your life!\\n\\nAs the sneaky Gnome you are, let\'s say you have a total of 12 Health Points.\\nDuring your day of adventuring, you will undoubtedly fight enemies, fall in traps and hurt yourself.\\nWhenever that happens, you will lose some of your Health Points.\\n\\nYou regain all of your lost Health Points back when your character takes an 8-hour break from adventuring in-game, in a safe environment; this is called a Long Rest.\\nLong Rests have nothing to do with real world time. You can just say \\"Let\'s take a Long Rest\\" and the Game Master might just say \\"Done, 8 hours have passed\\".\\nTake note that you can not Long Rest while camping in a forest, in a dungeon, wilderness, etc!\\n\\nDuring the gaming session, you will have to keep track yourself of how many Health Points you have, either on a sheet of paper or in a document. Don\'t cheat!\\nYour total amount of Health is calculated when you create your character; we\'ll get into that a bit later.\\n","Your Turn":"When it\'s your turn in combat, you can A) Move and B) use your Action (in any order).\\nEveryone can take an Action in combat and Move. Let\'s begin with moving.\\n","Moving":"When you decide to move, you can run a few meters in any direction, spending on your Speed.\\nAs a Gnome, your Speed is 4 meters per turn (the Speed of all Gnomes is 4 meters per turn). That means you can run 4 meters once per turn.\\n4 meters is just the maximum number of total meters you can move. You can move 2 meters up and 2 meters to the left, or move only 3 meters in any direction, or not move at all! It\'s up to you how you move.\\n","Actions":"Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses your hands (usually).\\n\\nThe most standard way to take your turn is to move once and then attack once (or attack and then move).\\nIf you want to do something that uses both hands, that\'s an Action.\\nBut what if you want to do something different with each hand? That\'s where Half-Actions come in.\\n","Half-Actions":"Half-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.\\nEssentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).\\nAny Action is just two Half-Actions combined. You want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That\'s 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that\'s simply the same as one Action.\\nThe term \\"Action\\" is just another word for \\"two Half-Actions\\".\\n\\nIf you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.\\n\\nBut it gets better! You don\'t actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn\'t matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.\\nOn your turn, you have 2 Half-Actions. Period. They are not tied to one hand or the other in particular. You want to make 2 Half-Actions with the same hand? You are free to do so!\\nIf you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. But don\'t worry about the numbers; the game is balanced around this.\\n\\nIn the future, when your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that\'s exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you\'d be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon. You\'re free to do whatever you want with your hands!\\n","Attacking, Weapons and Defense":"When you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon\'s dice and subtract the enemy\'s Defense.\\n\\nEvery weapon in the game does a certain amount of Damage and all weapons can be found on the Weapons page.\\nEvery weapon also benefits from either your Might or your Dexterity.\\nFor example, a Club deals 1d10 Damage and uses the Might Stat. So, whenever you attack with the Club, the Damage done by that attack is 1d8 + your Might. If you are the sneaky, slim Gnome, that means 1d8 - 1, which is not very good.\\nThe Whip, however, deals 1d4 + 3 Damage and uses Dexterity. Thus, if you are the sneaky Gnome, the Damage will be 1d4 + 6, which is much better!\\n\\nYou roll the Damage, and the enemy subtracts the Damage you deal from their Health Points. Your job is to get them to 0 or less Health.\\n\\nHowever, every character and monster has another number called Defense. Whenever it is attacked, their Defense reduces the amount of Damage they take by that amount.\\nFor example, if you attack the Bear and the attack would deal 7 Damage, the Bear does not just lose 7 Health, but instead subtracts its Defense from the attack.\\nBears\' Defense is 4, so, whevener the Bear is attacked, it reduces all incoming Damage by 4. 7 becomes 3. That\'s the final amount of Damage the Bear takes.\\n\\nTo conclude, the final Damage of your attack is: (Weapon Damage) + (your Might or Dexterity) - (enemy Defense).\\nIn this particular case with you being the Gnome and the enemy being the Bear, the total Damage is (1d6 + 1) + (3) - (4).\\n\\nNo matter if you use a 1-Handed Weapon (with Half-Actions) or a 2-Handed Weapon (with Actions), the formula is the same. Even if you use both hands, the formula doesn\'t change. It\'s always the same.\\n\\nRemember the magic formula for attacking: Weapon + Stat - Defense.\\n\\nThat\'s pretty much it for attacking! The next section will go a bit more into detail about some other tips and tricks for combat!\\n","Regaining Health":"Inherit Reserve Health Pool from Rules","Why Your Positioning Matters":"While on paper combat seems like a randomness fest, there are many other things that influence combat.\\nOne of the most important is positioning. If you shoot an arrow at an enemy behind a wall, it will obviously not be as efficient as if the enemy was standing in an open field.\\nIf you fall from above onto an enemy, that\'s more effective than just attacking normally.\\nThere is even a bonus for doing a cool stunt!\\n\\nDuring combat, there are all sorts of extra small bonuses or minuses you can get on your attacks, depending on how well you are positioned.\\nDon\'t bother with memorizing them for now. The Game Master will tell you when the time comes. Just remember positioning matters. If it makes sense that you ever get a penalty to an attack, you probably do. Ask the Game Master.\\nIf you want to see all of these penalties and bonuses, you can check the Attack Bonuses and Penalties page.\\n","Abilities":"An Ability is simply a block of text that either gives you some thing extra (passively) or gives you something else to do with your Actions rather than attacking.\\nEvery Race and Class gives you some special Abilities. You will know you have these Abilities if they are written on your character sheet.\\nIf you are a Gnome, you have some extra Abilities that Elves don\'t have.\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at exactly what Abilities you start with as a Gnome!\\n\\nFirst off, you have Inherited Tastes. You can see it\'s a Passive Ability, meaning you don\'t need to use it manually; it\'s always there, in the back of your mind. It\'s like an extra trait for your character.\\nInherited Tastes is very simple. You don\'t have a sense of taste, but your eyes perceive colors sharper than most. Doesn\'t sound like much, but it is an Ability!\\n\\nThen, let\'s look at Lucky Presence. This one is an Ability that you can actually use!\\nAfter someone else makes a Check, you can say \\"I use Lucky Presence\\" and they must roll the check again. Presumably, you would use this on your allies when they fail a Check, or on your enemies when they succeed a Check you would\'ve liked them to fail.\\nThere are 2 interesting things about this Ability: the first one is that it\'s a \\"Reaction\\". Reaction is another type of Action that you can only do on others\' turns. You can\'t do just anything with Reactions. Every Reaction is usually an Ability that has a specific time when you can use it. In this case, you must use Lucky Presence when someone makes a Check.\\nThe second thing to look at is the hourglass icon near which it says \\"Long Rest\\". This is called a Cooldown and it tells you how long you have to wait before you can use this Ability again after you use it once. If it has a Cooldown of Long Rest, that means you can use it once, and then you must finish a Long Rest before you can use it again.\\n\\nThat\'s all the Abilities Gnomes start with! Let\'s take a look at another Ability now, to see another example. We\'ll look at the Spell called Bonfire.\\nBonfire is a magical Spell, and it is only available to spell casters, like Mages and Shamans. When you cast this, you choose 1-cubic-meter zone where a bonfire is conjured, and it deals Damage! The Aability text itself is self explanatory and straight-forward.\\nBonfire takes 1 Action to do. So, on your turn, you\'d have to choose between attacking and casting Bonfire. Reminder that 1 Action is the same as 2 Half-Actions. So if you cast Bonfire, you can not do anything else with your hands this turn! And if you use one hand for a Half-Action, you can\'t cast Bonfire; because you are left with a Half-Action, and Bonfire takes 1 whole Action.\\nThe last thing to notice about Bonfire is the arrow-and-target icon where it says \\"6 meters\\". This simply means the spell Bonfire has a maximum range of 6 meters. The space you choose to cast Bonfire on must be within 6 meters of you (and you must be able to see the location, of course).\\n\\nLet\'s look into an Ability that\'s a little more _Advanced_, Healing Surge.\\nThe text is very short and straight-forward - you restore 2d6 Health to a Unit. \\nThe \\"Half-Action\\" and \\"5 meters\\" tags should also be self explanatory for you by now.\\nThe \\"1 Mana\\" text refers to the cost of this Ability. The next section will explain Spellcasting.\\n  \\n","Abilities Notes":"Generally, you will have to find a way to keep track of your Abilities. Sure, you can just write down the name of each Ability you have, but then you\'d have to search it online every time you want to do something. The easiest way to keep track is with the Ability Sheet Generator, which can be found at this link.\\n","Spellcasting":"You will see the word Spell - all Spells are Abilities. A Spell is just a normal Ability, but it\'s magical by nature.\\n","Mana Spellcasting":"All classes in the game use a system of points called Mana Points.\\nYou have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you finish a Long Rest (8 in-game hours of non-adventuring and resting in a safe environment, like a tavern).\\n\\nFor a clear example, let\'s take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points. The Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.\\nEach Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn\'t specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don\'t have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can\'t.\\n\\nWhen building your character, you will have to choose a number of Spells from a given list - you can\'t have them all, there are dozens in the game! You\'ll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Spells. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 out of all the Spells Mages can choose from. These will be all the Spells you will be able to Cast until you finish your next Long Rest (8 in-game hours of non-adventuring and resting in a safe environment, like a tavern).\\nThis is explained in further detail later on, at Character Creation.\\n\\nYou can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points. Don\'t cheat!\\n","Cooldown-based Spellcasting":"DEPRECATED","Wrapping up the basics":"Those are all the basics of the game! You can now play the game with your group!\\nAs mentioned several times, don\'t bother with remembering _everything_. It\'s merely good to have a general overview of how the game works before you get into it. It is always recommended you find a group where at least one person has experience playing any tabletop RPG, be it Pathfinder, Dungeons and Dragons or Call of Heroes. And if they have player D&D or Pathfinder but they are new to CoH, send them the D&D Transition Guide! It\'s a guide specifically for D&D players who want to learn Call of Heroes and explains all the differences and changes.\\n","Character Creation":"Building a character is one of the most fun aspects of the game and provides you with a way to express what kind of person you want to be in the adventure. While some adventures come with premade characters (like Don, the sneaky Gnome you were assigned in the previous sections of this guide), most games will have you make your own character.\\nThis section will guide you through all the steps for building a new character.\\n","Rest of Character Creation":"Inherit everything from CharacterCreation"}');function bn(){function e(e){var t=e.name;return(0,Ye.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(Wt,{children:t}),(0,Ye.jsx)("p",{children:vn[t]})]})}return document.title="How To Play (For New Players)",(0,Ye.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Ye.jsxs)(Pt,{title:"Call of Heroes",isSecondaryPage:!0,children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"What is Call of Heroes?"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"How do groups work?"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"How is it different from a board game?"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"What is a story or adventure like?"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"What should I buy to get started?"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"How do I get started?"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Learning the Rules"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Checking the Rules"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(At,{children:"Understanding Dice"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Dice"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Dice notation and calculations"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(At,{children:"Game Basics"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"How does it play out?"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Checks"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Stats"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Checks Continued"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Combat"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Turn order (and Initiative)"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Health"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Your Turn"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Moving"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Actions"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Half-Actions"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Attacking, Weapons and Defense"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Regaining Health"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Why Your Positioning Matters"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(At,{children:"Abilities and Spells"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Abilities"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Abilities Notes"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Spellcasting"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Mana Spellcasting"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Wrapping up the basics"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(At,{children:"Character Creation"}),(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:"Character Creation"})]}),(0,Ye.jsx)(Ut,{isSecondaryPage:!0})]})}function wn(e){ga(e);var t=Object.keys(ba);return(0,Ye.jsx)(Pt,{title:"Rules",children:(0,Ye.jsx)(pa,{columns:["Rule"],children:t.map((function(e){return(0,Ye.jsx)("tr",{children:(0,Ye.jsx)("td",{children:(0,Ye.jsx)(Oe,{to:"/Other/Rule#".concat(e),children:e})})},e)}))})})}var An=JSON.parse('{"Cover (-2)":"If you have Cover from another Unit, you take 2 less Damage from that Unit and have +2 to all Checks against that Unit.\\nA Unit has Cover if hiding from another Unit behind a small or medium object or another Unit (that you could logically shoot or attack over/through/around); e.g. being behind a fence, barrel, pillar, tree, etc.\\nCover does apply to melee attacks as well.\\nTo determine whether a Unit has cover from another Unit, draw a line from each corner of the space to each corner of the other Unit\'s space. If any of the lines is obstructed by an obstacle, then it has Cover.\\n\\nCover is not necessarily 2-way. If you have Cover from an enemy, it does not mean the enemy has Cover from you. Apply reason.

You, as the attacker, can keep the rest of your body safe while only exposing part of yourself when attacking. When in doubt, apply common sense or ask the Game Master.\\n\\nFor example, if you are hiding behind a rock and another Unit shoots an arrow at you that would normally deal 8 Damage, the arrow now deals 6 Damage. Or, if a Unit makes you roll a Dexterity Check and you have Cover from that Unit, you gain +2 to the roll. Or, if a Unit casts Magic Missiles on you and shoots 3 missiles (1d4 each), and you have Cover from that Unit, each missile will now deal 1d4 - 2 Damage (down to 0).\\nTip: If you play on a grid and walls obstruct Line of Sight strictly around the corners of its squares, then a ranged Unit can hide behind the margin of a wall and shoot from there if it has Line of Sight from any of its space\'s corner to any of the enemy\'s space\'s corners. If the line in the Line of Sight merely touches the space of the wall, then it\'s ok; it does have Line of Sight. If it goes through that space, then it does not have Line of Sight (see the Line of Sight rule for a more detailed explanation).\\n\\nCertain Abilities ignore Cover.\\n\\nCover does not stack (e.g. you can\'t get 2 Covers and take -4 Damage - it\'s still just one Cover, just -2).\\n","Flanked (+1)":"Melee attacks on Flanked Units gain +1.\\nIf you are melee-attacking a Unit and there\'s one of your allies directly behind (1 meter) your target, the attack is Flanking and gains +1.\\nNormally, you, your target and the ally behind it are supposed to form a straight line for the attack to count as Flanking, but this works even if your ally behind the target is one space too much to the left or to the right (but still within 1 meter of the target).

Ln=JSON.parse('{"Where to find monsters":"All monsters are found at GM Resources > Monsters.\\nBefore continuing to read this section, take a look at some Monsters to get used to the monster stat block.\\nMost numbers you see are self-explanatory, but all other things are explained below.\\n","How to play monsters":"Monsters function similarly to players, but with a few simple changed rules:\\n1. Monsters have fixed initiative and don\'t roll for initiative (and their initiative is unaffected by Dexterity or Charisma; the number you see at Initiative is what you get).\\nSome monsters have different Initiative if they start as Ranged attackers vs if they start as Melee attackers.\\n2. Monsters don\'t have Half-Actions and Mana\\nEach turn, a monster can choose one of its Abilities (the white blocks with a RED line on top).\\nIf an Ability says it\'s free, then it takes no Action (0 Actions) (e.g. Naga Mage - Enslave Magic can be cast by each Naga Mage once per combat, for free, without using an Action).\\nIf an Ability says (x2) or (x3), then the monster makes that many attacks with that Ability (e.g. Koblods 1H Weapon). So, if a monster decides to use that Ability, if it says (x2), then it will use that Ability TWICE. For our Koblods, their 1H Weapon Ability has an (x2) noted and it deals 1d6 + 2 Damage, so all Koblods make 2 attacks, each of which deals 1d6 + 2.\\nFor 1 Action, Monsters can make the following Default Moves (even if they cost a Half-Action): Dash, Defend, Taunt, Push, Taunt, Intimidating Mock. Defend applies twice (as if it used it twice, for 2 Half-Actions).\\n3. Some monsters have fixed Damage per attack, but might also have a dice alternative. Prefer using the fixed values if there are any, to make combat faster. Monsters can choose to roll the dice if needed, if the fixed Damage is just too low (e.g. 5 Damage but the target has 6 Defense).\\n","$Monster Passives":"Each monster might have some Passive Abilities (white blocks with a BLUE line on top).\\n","$Monster suggestions":"On the right side of the monster page, there are some simple suggestions for how to play monsters of that type (e.g. \\"Koblods run away after they finish attacking\\", or \\"Each Stonemantle flies and targets one enemy\\").\\nThere are also suggestions on what obstacles to add to the fight, what other monsters to add to the encounter, and there might also be some ideas for interesting ways to use the monsters.\\n","$Playing monsters fairly":"Monsters should generally try to distribute their attacks and Damage among the players.\\nIt doesn\'t feel fair if all the monsters to attack a single player and kill them in the first round of combat. Try to have monsters attack different targets.\\n","Encounter XP":"Building a combat encounter for your players is very simple!\\nEach team of Players or Monsters has a certain Encounter Budget. Each Player has an Encounter Budget and the total Encounter Budget of the party is the sum of all players\' Encounter Budgets.\\nSame for monsters. The total Encounter Budget of a group of monsters is equal to the sum of each monster\'s Encounter Budget.\\nA Level 1 Player has an Encounter Budget of 100 XP.\\nWhen building an encounter, the idea is to have the Player Encounter Budget be equal to the Monster Encounter Budget for a standard, medium difficulty encounter.\\nA perfectly balanced encounter is intended to take away 50% of all players\' Health and 33% of their total Mana.\\n","$1. Calculate the Encounter Budget for the players":"Each Player\'s Experience Budget goes from 100 XP at Level 1 to 400 XP at Level 10.\\nSee the table below for accurate XP information.\\nNote that 175, 275 and 375 are skipped straight to 200, 300 and 400. That\'s because of the power spikes for the players at certain levels.\\nSo, if you have 4 Players of Level 1, that\'s 4 x 100 XP, so 400 Experience Budget for a party of 4 Players of Level 1.\\n","$2. Calculate the Encounter Budget for the monsters":"Each monster has a different Encounter Budget. For example, a Wolf has 75 XP, but a Gnoll has 150 XP. A Fairy Dragon has 500 XP.\\nYou must mix and match monsters so their total Encounter Budget is somewhat equal to the players\' total Encounter Budget.\\nFor a party of 4 Players of Level 1, 4 Bat Swarms is exactly a medium difficulty encounter (100 XP * 4). 5 Wolves (75 XP * 5) is also a somewhat medium encounter for our player group (375 XP for the wolves).\\n","$Encounter Budget for monster numbers (important)":"The more monsters you add to an encounter (respecting the Encounter Budgets), the EASIER it is.\\nFor example, let\'s compare two different encounters: 4 Koblods (4 * 100 XP = 400 XP) and 8 Hounds (8 * 50 = 400 XP). These two encounters have the exact same Budget.\\nHowever, the 8 Hounds encounter is easier, because of several reasons:\\n1. Players have Area Abilities, and can kill multiple Hounds at the same time.\\n2. It\'s easier to kill each Hound one by one (e.g. even if 2 Hounds are as strong as 1 Koblod, if one Hound dies from 10 Damage, then 1 Hound remains and it\'s weaker than 1 Koblod; on the other hand, 1 Koblod doesn\'t die from 10 Damage).\\nTo balance this, subtract 5% from the Encounter Budget for each extra monster more than the number of players. So, if we have 4 Players and 8 Hounds, that is 4 extra Hounds compared to the players. 4 * 5% = 20%. So we subtract 20% from our 400 XP hounds (20% 400 XP = 80 XP) and we find out that the true Encounter Budget of our Hounds encounter is actually worth only 320 XP. 320 XP is an Easy-Medium encounter for the players.\\nYou should not subtract more than 50% from the Encounter Budget.\\nOn the other hand, having fewer monsters than the number of players should not require a decrease in XP budget.\\n","$Monster Degree":"Monsters are either Normal monsters or Epic monsters (bosses).\\nNormal monsters are normal.\\nEpic monsters take MULTIPLE turns, one after another, depending on their Degree.\\nFor example, an Ogre has a Degree of 2. That literally means an Ogre will take 2 turns in a row (e.g. moves and takes an action, then starts its next turn and can move and take an action again).\\n","Epic Monsters":"Epic monsters take MULTIPLE turns, one after another, depending on their Degree.\\nFor example, an Ogre has a Degree of 2. That literally means an Ogre will take 2 turns in a row (e.g. moves and takes an action, then starts its next turn and can move and take an action again).\\nAlso, an Epic monster must alternate its Abilities (non-passives). If it has 3 Abilities, it can\'t choose to use only one of them all the time. It must use the first Ability on one turn, then the 2nd Ability next turn, an then the 3rd Ability on its next turn. Then it can use the 1st Ability again on the next turn, and so on.\\nIt is up to the GM to choose the order of the Abilities.\\nIf the Epic monster can\'t use an Ability, it will not use it. If it has no other Abilities to use, and can\'t use that Ability or it makes no sense to use that Ability, it will just not do an Action.\\n","Epic vs Normal Monsters":"You might be asking yourself, for example - what is the difference between a 500 XP normal monster and a 500 XP x2 Epic monster in terms of strength?\\nA 500 XP x2 Epic Monster is akin to 2 250 XP normal Monsters, and takes 2 actions, thus making it easier to spread out Damage. Its stats are also calculated to match 2 250 XP monsters - slightly lower total Damage output and health.\\nA 500 XP normal Monster will usually make one attack that deals massive Damage. The danger here is that one very high XP monster might kill a player character in one hit, while the Epic monster will spread its Damage out.\\n","$Monster Degree Note":"Note that Crowd Control lasts for 1 turn. If your monster has a Degree of 2, it takes 2 TURNS, one after another. The Crowd Control only lasts for ONE turn, so it applies to its first turn only, NOT to both (if its lasts normally for 1 turn).\\nAlso, if the Epic monster has a Crowd Control on it (e.g. is Stunned), and another player adds another Crowd Control (e.g. another Stun), the second Stun does NOT go on the monster\'s second turn. All the Crowd Control from the players is applied to the monster\'s first turn only.\\n","Homebrewing Monsters":"The best way to make a homebrew monster is to take the stat block of an official existing monster, keep its Health, Defense and XP (or slightly change them) and give it different Stats, Abilities, Passives, etc.\\nWhen you make custom Abilities for your monster, do check out the Abilities of other similar monsters to see how powerful they should be.\\nIf you want to make a homebrew monster by the book, check the following table for some standard numbers.\\nAdust the Health of a monster by about 10% for each extra/missing point of Defense compared to its base Defense from the table (e.g. For a 100 XP monster with 4 Defense, it should have about 18 Health).\\nFreely add certain Damage type resistances or Crowd Control to monsters.\\n","Homebrewing Philosophy":"When making a homebrew monster, apply the following suggestions:\\n- Crowd Control should require a Check (e.g. don\'t make an Ability that just outright Roots or Silences the player)\\n- Avoid Stuns, Paralyses, Sleep etc. It\'s not fun for a player to skip its turn.\\n- Do give your monster Silence, Daze, Fumbling, Slow, Charm, Fear or Blind Abilities. These will make your players alter their playstyle.\\n- Do give your monster 50% Resistance to certain Damage types (within reason). These will also make your players alter their playstyle.\\n- Do make the Health of some monsters be 50% Shielding instead of Health. Some Player Abilities might remove Shielding.\\n- Avoid giving Epic Monsters extra bonuses to Resist Checks; Stat bonuses should be enough, plus they take multiple turns.\\n- Avoid giving Epic Monsters \\"Epic Resistances\\" (e.g. \\"if it fails a Resist Check, it can choose to pass it instead\\"). This is a special thing some monsters have in other games, but Call of Heroes does not endorse this type of Ability.\\n- Avoid \\"Pass or Die\\" Abilities (e.g. avoid giving your monsters Abilities that do huge amounts of Damage if the player fails the Check, or Abilities that do huge Damage directly).\\n- Avoid crazy dice swings (e.g. avoid giving monsters attacks that can wildly swing between very little Damage or a lot of Damage). For example, avoid giving your monster an attack that deals 2d12 Damage, because that is at minimum 2 Damage and at maximum 24 Damage, but the average is 13 Damage. If you want to deal 13 Damage, a more fair roll would be 2d8 + 4, or 2d6 + 6, or 4d4 + 3, for example.\\n- Do be inventive and creative! Give your monsters certain small gimmicks! Monsters in Call of Heroes aren\'t just stat blocks. Players should adjust their strategy to defeat every different monster!"}');function On(){function e(e){var t=e.name;return(0,Ye.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(At,{children:t}),(0,Ye.jsx)("p",{children:Ln[t]})]})}function t(e){var t=e.name,a=t.startsWith("$")?t.substring(1):t;return(0,Ye.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Ye.jsx)(Wt,{children:a}),(0,Ye.jsx)("p",{children:Ln[t]})]})}return console.log(Object.keys(Ln)),(0,Ye.jsxs)(Pt,{title:"Encounters",children:[(0,Ye.jsx)("p",{children:"This page contains all the rules, necessary information and tips for how to make encounters and how to play monsters as a Game Master."}),Object.keys(Ln).map((function(a){return(0,Ye.jsxs)("div",{children:[a.startsWith("$")?(0,Ye.jsx)(t,{name:a}):(0,Ye.jsx)(e,{name:a}),"$1.
